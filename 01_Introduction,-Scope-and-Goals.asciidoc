Executive Summary
-----------------

Two billion people are connected to the internet.  Almost $8 trillion exchange hands each year through e-commerce. Having a web property that is highly responsive to users, runs flawlessly 24x7, and enables mobile commerce is the baseline for what you can expect to develop and deploy in today's Internet economy.  The Internet's total contribution to the World GDP is bigger that the GDP of Spain or Canada and is growing faster than Brazil.  And yet the internet is still in its infancy, but a critical element to world economic growth. But is web performance keeping up with the sheer growth in size and complexity of the Internet? 

This Radar Report includes data from our Jobs data-mart, Google trends, retail book trends and some general scraping and collecting of internet data to surface any trends surrounding the current State of the Web Performance Optimization market. Closely related to WPO is Web Operations that basically ensures that your fast performing web property will continue to deliver 24x7. And even though web operations is closely related to WPO, we are not going to focus on that discipline in this report.  So let's take a look at the growth of the Web and the new burgeoning discipline of Web Performance Optimization - WPO.

If you figure that the global average connection speed is 2.3 Mbps and the global average peak connection speed is 11.7 Mbps*1, how fast will web sites need to be effectively serve data at the peak rate or to satisfy the connection rate lower end of the speed scale.  

The Overall Market
-----------------

The following image contains data from our Simplyhired Datamart and indicates the average number of job postings, on the Y axis, for each time sequence on the X axis.  I compared the performance topics with SysAdmin for a baseline so you can see fluctuations in the overall market and the growth rate of web performance optimizations topics and tools.  What this chart indicates is that

The next image places our Velocity Conferences that we've held during the past few years with the same Job data.  I do see a trend in that immediately following the conference we see a spike in WPO job postings.  And remember this is half of the DevOps and WPO audience that typically makes up our Velocity demographics.

Introduction to Performance

This is a placeholder to see if this is working. Ad this just does not seem to get put.

Nature of Speed
---------------

According to Wikipedia, speed is the rate of change, motion or activity. Optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently.  So let's take a look at the current set of tools, techniques and best practices that developers can use to optimize their web properties for speed and efficiency.
