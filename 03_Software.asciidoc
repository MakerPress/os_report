== Software Used By BlueHost Customers

Bluehost offers more than 94 different software packages and services that users can select from when signing up for a hosting plan. There are 26 categories of software and services including Backups, Blogs, Business Tools, Classifieds, Client Management, Content Management, eCommerce, Education, Forms and Surveys, Forums, Guestbooks, Help Center, Live Chat, Mailing Lists, Photo Galleries, Product Sourcing, Project Management, RSS, Security, Social Networking, Statistics, Utilities, Webmail, Website Builders, Website Design, and Wiki. Far and away the most common applications selected by customers, though, fall into two categories: Content Management Systems such as WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, and eCommerce systems such as Magento, OScommerce, and Prestashop.

In addition to the SMB customer profile of the typical Bluehost users, there is a technology stack that is being used regularly. The term stack here means the layers of technology you put on top of a base of Unix/Linux or Windows. For example, someone may have a stack of Linux with MySql managing a database, and PHP to insert or retrieve data from the database, and Wordpress on top for publishing blogs and informational pieces. This is a simple and somewhat sloppy stack, because you can do more with each layer than we touched on, but for the purposes of illustrating a stack, it should suffice. First let's look at the underlying operating system component and the percentage of users in different countries using Linux/Unix.

image::images/mostUsedTools.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

We looked at MySql and the number of sites that had just one instance of the DB running, and those with more than 1, and those with more than 10.  The ones with more than ten represent a fairly sophisticated user. Users who understand they need more Database instances, and not just more *tables in their Database*, have some interesting dynamics going on with their website. Those with two or more instances, roughly 55% of all MySql users, are are harder to figure out if they are truly using more instances for business, or experimenting, or truly need more than one DB as they scale. At the SMB level, we think it is fair to say those with more than ten databases are heavy users, which is 7% of all MySql users.

image::images/MysqlHeavyUse.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

So we know the most common tools in use are WordPress, PHP and Javascript. And the most common paired tool sets in use in our Bluehost data are, MySql and WordPress, then WordPress and PHP, then WordPress and Javascript as shown in the chart below. They all represent around 30% market share for all users that have at least one tool installed.

image::images/mostUsedComboTools.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The fact that Javascript and PHP are so popular with Bluehost users, means there is something more than just "this is my blog" going on with the users we find in the data. These languages along with MySql allow web developers to do build pretty innovative features on their website. SMBs can use the same open source stacks that built many large companies. Think for a moment about how Facebook got started with PHP and continues to use it. This is from their developer site, "Our Platform engineering team has released and maintains open source SDKs for Android, iOS, JavaScript and PHP." footnote:[https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/[Facebook Developers]]

The following image shows the the MySql users who have what we call a heavy usage pattern with Javascript. Any Javascript (any JS) represents about 88% of the number of MySql users who program with Javascript, and 47% have medium usage (med JS) of the language, while only 9% have what we call heavy usage (big JS).

image::images/JavaScriptMySQLHeavyUse.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The next image shows the same heavy usage pattern, but this time with PHP and MySql. Any PHP (any PHP) represents about 95% of the number of MySql users who program with PHP, and 57% have medium usage (med PHP) of the language, while 11% have what we call heavy usage (big PHP). So it appears as though PHP has more programmers with heavy usage of MySql and PHP than MySql and Javascript.  

image::images/PHPMySQLHeavyUse.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

WordPress was built as a big instance of PHP and MySql so naturally there are lots of MySql and PHP files found in the Bluehost user data. And you will notice that on the WordPress.org site if you navigate to hosting tab, Bluehost is the first hosting provider listed where you find that Bluehost offers you 50 free MySql databases in your plan. As you've seen, the most common pairing with either Javascript or PHH, and MySql is WordPress. WordPress has hundreds of plugins that programmers can take advantage of. For instance, Slider Evolution is a JQuery plugin that lets you easily create powerful Javascript photo sliders with very nice transition effects, but you may need to tweak the .js code to avoid conflicts with other themes and plugins. The point is when an SMB starts using more sophisticated WordPress Plugins, they are going to start doing some Javascript, PHP or MySql work. As a SMB business evolves, typically so does their level of interaction with programming or hiring/contracting a programmer.

== SMB's Tech Tools to Build an Online Web Presence

BlueHost users are offered an array of software packages to use with their hosted platform.  The most common choices are a CMS such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal. A small percentage of users host their own e-commerce capabilities. A small percentage do their own programming in various open source languages.

// Fix the following paragraph to match the simplified tables, as described in my email - TOR

The image below shows the stack and relative market share for each layer of the stack. The tables following will provide the specific numbers for each component in the stack.

|CMS|All users|% share of All users
|WordPress|277,074|41%
|Drupal|16,109|2%
|Joomla|40,838|6%
|=======

Now let's look at the same data for e-commerce. So you can see that Oscommerce is by far the largest installed tool for doing e-commerce on a Bluehost account. Indirectly, those SMBs that use PayPal may be using Magento as well because PayPal purchased Magento awhile back. That is not measured here.

|E-commerce|All users|% share
|Magento	 |4,896 |1%
|Oscommerce	 |10,023 |1%
|Prestashop	 |1,071 |0%
|=======

In addition to content management and e-commerce, there are an additional five technologies that are offered to Bluehost subscribers. We have labeled them as a miscellaneous suite of tools. Phpbb is a bulletin board tool, Simple Machine Forum (SMF) is a forum builder tool, Mediawiki is tool to build a wiki that allows users to edit content, Moodle is an Educational tool to manage class work, and Coppermine is a photo management tool.

|Simple machines| 3,296|0%
|Mediawiki| 2,816|0%
|Moodle| 3,077|1%
|Coppermine| 3,412|0%
|=======

=== Technology Cross Adoption

As we said above, many of the technologies work well in suites, pairs or stacks. For instance, MySql and PHP are a commonly paired technology tools. Yet there are some surprises when you look at what users install and couple with other technologies. 

What we have found in the data is that there are two main components to SMBs on hosted services. One component is the information dissemination role a tool can play. WordPress, Joomla and Drupal are content management systems that help users publish information and represent this first component. e-Commerce is a more subtle component that reflects a more sophisticated SMB user of a hosted service. This is an apparent component that is truly generating revenue. I say *apparent* because we cannot measure how many website owners take credit card orders by email or regular mail, or how much they are specifically making from Google Ad Words. If we look to see the presence of a commerce engine, we get a view of the SMB stack and pairing. 

The following image shows the number of CMS users that have a commerce solution included in their hosted service. What is interesting to note is that WordPress, although it is by far the market leader, does not get paired as often with a e-commerce solution. We believe that running your own e-commerce tool on a website reflects a more sophisticated user, which is represented by Joomla and Drupal. Both of these CMS tools are considered more difficult to fully operate than WordPress, but likely are more powerful when paired with e-commerce tools.

==== Analysis of the CMS Tools

The big three CMSs are WordPress, Joomla and Drupal and they remain in firm command of the market, although the category is dominated by WordPress. Whether you look at Job trends, Google Trends, or Bluehost user data, WordPress is the leading CMS tool. For many SMBs, WordPress is all they need to engage their customers, and even do some rudimentary sales where they put a phone number on their website to call/order and they take your credit card directly via the phone. Again, this was not measured in any of our data sets, but it is quite common in practice.

==== Trends:

So the interesting piece of information to take from this first image is not necessarily the dominance of WordPress, but rather that PHP and Javacript users are the typical languages used. This makes sense because if WordPress is considered the easiest of the CMSs to use, and we believe that PHP and Javascript are likewise the easiest languages to use in our data set. So this pairing of WordPress and PHP and Javascript makes perfect sense. Joomla seems to benefit more equally from PHP, Javascript and Perl even though it was created with PHP.

image::images/CMS_Language.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Because we wanted to see if there were any pairings that made sense or just happened organically, we looked to see which languages had heavy usage. Ones that make sense could be the number of Plugins that are written by a specific language so that can influence a choice. Or the language was built in a particular language, like Joomla and PHP, so there may be some organic chemistry with the tool and language. We looked at file counts and determined which language paired with a CMS has the most heavy usage. Again, no surprises here except perhaps that Joomla is quite strong in heavy usage with both PHP and Javascript. PHP is the most used language in this study. It could be much like the Cobol or C of the Web at this point in time. In other words, there are tons of legacy PHP code on websites still in use and it may be easier to maintain those files than replace with a new language. The benefits of changing may not be inline with the goals of the SMB website maintainer.

In the 2011 Open Source CMS Market Share Report footnote:[http://www.waterandstone.com/book/2011-open-source-cms-market-share-report[water&stone]] they identify that their audience of more than 2,500 respondents 20% were 1-person only sites and 33% were between 2-10-person shops. This certainly represents SMBs and their report clearly shows that WordPress in Weekly Downloads, is about a factor of 8 times that of the next closest competitor of Joomla. Total installs are about 4.3m compared to 1.7m for Joomla. The magnitude of dominance is also what we find in the Bluehost data. But, interestingly enough, the Google Trends for the CMSs measured are not a far off as would appear from the other sources. Seems like a much higher percentage of Bluehost customers, water&stone respondents, and job advertisements skew towards Wordpress in a fairly large fashion.

TECHi has an excellent write up and InfoGraphic titled Open source wars: Wordpress vs Drupal vs Joomla footnote:[http://www.techi.com/2011/07/open-source-wars-wordpress-vs-drupal-vs-joomla/[TECHi]] that provides an excellent comparison of the features and costs of the three large CMSs. Here is a summary of cost components that may make the platforms more palatable for a SMB.

[options="header"]
|======= 
|What   |Wordpress|Joomla| Drupal
|Cost to set up|$250-$15,000|$5,000 - $50,000|$2,000 - $20,000
|Avg Monthly Maintenance |$250|$1,500|$500
|Number of Plugins|14,629|8,039|7,609
|Number of Themes|1,392 |885|54-100 footnote:[http://www.themepartner.com/blog/55/how-many-templates-for-joomla-are-there/[ThemePartner]]
|Monthly Visits to Main Site|50,000,000|55,700|59,600
|=======

===== Analysis

Although the costs to set up and maintain a CMS may vary widely from the table above, the general pattern of Wordpress being on the lower end of cost to setup, maintain and ease of usability make this the most popular tool for managing content. In our Bluehost data, the number of users that have WordPress installed and use MySql too is 78%, while Joomla is 16% and Drupal is 6%. This may indicate that WordPress users are capturing names, addresses, and user information using MySql while Joomla and Drupal users are likely using a programming language to do the same. Let's dig into programming languages a bit and see what is going on with SMBs and languages.


== What Languages Mean to SMBs

The presence of a programming language use indicates a more sophisticated SMB website. Languages typically mean there is some sort of dynamic action going on on the site or there is a need to handle more complex transactions, data transformations, information input or output and a variety of other functions that would be tedious to do manually. Perl is still well represented even though activity has tailed off quite a bit the past few years. At one time it was referred to as the Duct Tape of the Web because it was extremely useful as a language because you could make it do about anything we related. 

Top level trends for the which programming languages are contributing to the small business growth referenced in this work, are found in the chart immediately below. As you can see, PHP leads JavaScript by roughly 6% points. The two combined account for roughly 80% of the language activity on Bluehost. As mentioned, the only other language with a double-digit representation is Perl.

image::images/languageChoice.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

In addition to choice of Language, the chart below shows a logarithmic view of the programming languages and their growth for the years between 2001-01 and 2012-06.  The most notable spike was in 2004 and Python and Ruby both suddenly burst up the scale. All languages had a spike at this time which makes me think it more likely a reflection of Bluehost acquiring another hosting company that had those two languages offered to their customers. Python grew by a magnitude of 10 during the first few months and Javascript kept doubling its size every couple of months. Again, this could be a result of Bluehost acquiring smaller hosting companies that had particular language orientations. It does not look like organic growth, but rather engineered growth. One other language stands out a bit. Perl seems to have hit a wall around 2007 and has been flat or on a slight trend down. A closer look shows that Ruby, ASP, and Python can join Perl in the Bluehost doldrums for language growth from 2007 to present.

image::images/languagesAllYears.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Now lets look at all the languages that are in job postings during the previous three years. You will notice that in each of these charts there is a faint green area plot behind the bars. Those green areas show the peaks and valleys of all jobs, not just tech or the specific language. This way you get a sense if the whole US economy is trending up or down and does the language mirror that trend.

=== Trends:

Javascript seems to be a close proxy to what is happening in the overall market. There are few monthly instances where Javascript is counter to the overall market. March 2009 is an easy anomaly to spot. Pay attention to the scale as the other languages are not quite as big, so the charts may look similar, but scale is important.
   
image::images/javascript.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The next chart is Perl and as noted above, there was a slowing in job postings starting in 2007 which is not evident in this view. As you can see, Perl is still a widely used language, partially because of its alleged *duct-tape* capabilities. If we able to show Job data back to the early to mid 2000's, I am sure Perl would have been at the top or near the top for Job advertisements.

image::images/perl.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

PHP is on the same scale as Perl but has twenty weeks higher than the 200 (so does Javascript) on the X axis whereas Perl had two. PHP is very dominant in the Bluehost data partially due to the fact that many users consider themselves as beginners in Web Development. Again, PHP is a good beginners' language because you can quickly get data in and out of a MySql table without a steep learning curve.

image::images/php.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Python is measured on a higher scale than PHP and Perl, and is consistently above the 200 threshold. Python's job posting trend is very consistent going up at a average rate of 28% for the period reflected. Python is reaching into other industries like Life Sciences, Financial and scientific settings were there is significant mathematical equations are needed. This may be part of the growth in Job advertisements for Python. 

image::images/python.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

When you look at job postings and growth, Ruby surprised us with 8 weeks higher than the 400 threshold job postings per week. None of the languages measured here even have one week above 400 postings. So there is considerable action with Ruby and that could be attributed to Rails being a hot web framework for web developers. There is probably a loose correlation with start-ups quickly prototyping with Rails and Ruby makes sense as the driving language Job advertisements. Ruby certainly is not on the same growth pattern in Google trends, Bluehost data, or our Bookscan retails sales of books.

image::images/ruby.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

C# as a language has moderate growth and only a few weeks above 200. I think this language needs to be compared against Java and other enterprise type languages. We are not convinced that moderately experienced Web Programmers think of using C# when beginning a new project.

image::images/csharp.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

ASP is also a surprise that is is as low as reflected in the chart below. It does follow the seasonal patterns of the overall job market, but has only three weeks above 200. Makes us speculate that PHP and Javascript are continuing to eat into the ASP market.

image::images/asp.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

=== Analysis

When looking at all these languages there are a couple of points that stand out. First, they are not all targeted for Web Programming. C# and to a lessor extent Python, are general purpose languages. Python is likely the most versatile in finding a home in many different settings, including Life Sciences, Computer Science, Health IT and other areas where either numerics or engineering requirements are strong. C# is much more of a strong enterprise language for Microsoft platforms. Although Ruby has some similar characteristics as Python, it is more closely related to PHP, Javascript, and Perl for its use in Web Programming. At least from a job posting perspective, Ruby is the clear leader. From a language usage perspective, PHP and Javascript are dominant among Bluehost web site builders. We have noticed in the past couple of years that Javascript seems to be the most important language to learn if you want to program on the web. Libraries, tools, learnability, flexibility are some of the factors helping this language become number one in use and importance.
