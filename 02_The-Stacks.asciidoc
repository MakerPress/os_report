== The Stacks--Customers and Technology


=== Size and Composition of the Data Sets

As we have seen, Open Source can be a significant savings for SMBs which can act as a kickstart their fledgling business. We are going to take a look at the typical Customer Profile and Technology Stack that represents the SMBs we studied. Before we go too much further into the data and analysis, it should be noted that Bluehost has provided us with a substantial amount of data. First, the data is fairly US-centric. That is, more than 70% of the hosted sites are based in the US. And we need to keep in mind that the data is skewed towards English-speaking countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, which are the top four countries. The following pie chart shows the nature of the relative market share for the top five countries. The remaining parts of the world make up roughly 15% of the remaining market share.

image::images/top5.jpg[scalewidth="100%"]

The Bluehost data has a little more than a million records that we are going to share only relevant information from. There will be no user-specific information as it does not pertain to the purpose of this report. We also have more than 4,000 answers to a fairly significant number of questions that Bluehost used to survey their customers. We have a jobs data mart that contains electronic job listings for several years. This data mart contains terabytes of data and has undergone some extensive clean up to disambiguate words like Administration, Performance, Java, Ruby, etc. And we have use of our Nielsen Bookscan data mart which has point of sales data back to 2003. Google trends will also be used in relevant places throughout the report.

=== Internet Growth by Region and Country 

==== SMB growth, hosted services (Bluehost), and growth of IPv4 addresses (Akamai) 

The following image shows two different, yet very similar pictures of the world. In this view, we compared 2010 with 2011 in the number of new Hosted Services that were established in each given year and compared that to Akamai's report on new IPv4 addresses established in 2011. Basically we were looking to see if the data we are working with is indicative of the industry as a whole. Each blue number represents the country rank for the growth of new hosted services as reported by Bluehost. The pink number represents the rank of growth in new IPv4 addresses reported by Akamai. What's notable here is that the UK was the only country that had better rank for new hosted services than their growth rank for new IPv4 addresses. The US and China seem to be the most consistent in both ranks. Japan, Germany, and France showed the largest decline in SMB hosted services growth as compared to the number of new IPv4 addresses. But on the whole, the data from Bluehost is very consistent with the 'hard' data from Akamai.

image::images/Akamai_Bluehost_1.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The image immediately above and table below represent the growth in unique IPv4 addresses as seen by Akamai Technologies, Inc.footnote:[http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/[The State of the Internet, 4th Quarter, 2011 Report]] This is how many new unique IPv4 addresses have been identified by Akamai, and does not include any of the IPv6 addresses nor the forced decline in IPv4 addresses being assigned because of austerity measures by APNIC because of pending exhaustion of available addresses. Akamai reports on the top 10 countries and their number of unique IP addresses created in 2011, and the relative change rate from both Q4 2010 vs. Q4 2011, and the full year change rate. Again, this is to set the context for how generalizable the data is from Bluehost.

The table immediately below shows the growth rate of the top 20 countries that added new hosted services from 2010 to 2011. These countries are listed in order of number of sites (descending) and then Rank for their overall growth in the number of new hosted sites in 2011 compared with 2010. Growth percentage is also shown so you can get some perspective on how quickly the top 20 are growing. Look at the rate at which China is adding new hosted service sites. More than 70% growth for China between 2010 and 2011. We believe that roughly 164,000 of the 682,000 users in the Data represent SMBs. This is roughly 24% of the number of Bluehost hosted sites in the United States.

Let's first take a look at which countries are growing the quickest in signing up for new hosted services. You could view this as a proxy for small economies growing rapidly. The image shows which countries had the highest rank and what their relative growth rate was for the full-year comparing 2010 to 2011. Remember the pie chart from above, this chart now dives into growth. The order of countries, left to right, is based on overall size with the US on the bottom left being the largest, as we saw above, and Saudia Arabia being the last to make the top 20 countries. In addition to being ranked #1, The US had a growth rate of roughly 40% in 2011 when compared to 2010. China on the other hand, was ranked #5 but had a growth rate more than 70%. It does make you think about how long it will take China to move to the top spot. Anecdotally, the mid-50's taxi driver that has driven me and my colleagues around China the past few years, now has a Website. Could this just an enterprising taxi driver, or a sign that the masses in China will soon be grabbing themselves a hosted site. Of the top 20 growth countries, the three with the most growth percentage were Thailand, China and Indonesia. So something is certainly happening in Asia with SMB growth. Perhaps a chicken and egg problem with the Middle class in Asia now desiring more of everything and they find themselves having resources to purchase hosted services. Or is this a case of new SMBs contributing to the the growth of the middle class in these Asian nations. Or most likely, both scenarios are in play.

Now let's look at the market in general to get some context. Below are six charts that will help set some perspective. The first chart shows NASDAQ's closing for each week from 2009-01 through 2012-05 which is our study range for these six charts. The next chart shows the Google Trends results for the technologies offered to customers in the Bluehost Service plans. The remaining four charts show 1) job trends, 2) tech job trends, 3) tech book sales in retail, and 4) growth of Bluehost users. 

Our job data set contains terabytes of text and is for the US only. Basically the tech jobs data are the result a filter of the whole job market where we selected only the technologies offered by Bluehost to their customers. This way we can compare similar growth trends. The third data set/chart contains Tech Book Retail sales reported by Nielsen Bookscan. This allows us to see if there is any similar seasonal effects. Lastly we have user growth rates for Bluehost Service plans. This shows how many new users are added to Bluehost accounts. Since only BlueHost and Google Trend data are global, we filtered the Bluehost data to be US only and between 2009-present. Obviously NASDAQ is limited to US only. Google does not provide the option of filtering on US only and the results are completely dominated by non-US data. The US did not make the top ten in Google Trends for the topics selected. From a City perspective, only San Francisco made the top ten at #6. So the Google Trend data is a little less localized for a true comparison. But still interesting to see that is more closely matches the Tech Retail Book Sales data. The interpretation of Google trends and Books sales could perhaps be, if fewer people are searching for a topic each subsequent year, fewer folks will be buying books on the subject. However, individuals and SMBs still seem inclined to set up new hosted websites and advertise for available Job positions.

As you can see in four of the six charts, the trend line is moving upward which indicates growth, yet the Technical book Market shows a consistent decline. Although these measures are not correlated, they do provide some perspective on *technology adoption and demand*. Perhaps it is only a faint signal, but enough to at least consider. Again, we compared 2009 to the present because our Job data is not as reliable the further we go back. Much of the data in the remaining report will be for 2001 to present because Bluehost has reliable data for that period. 

image::images/nasdaq1.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

When you look at the NASDAQ closings for each week but plotted by month since 2009 and compare it to the Search Topics for the same technologies found in the Bluehost services offering, you see two charts going in different directions. Why I'd look at these two dimensions is for some context before looking specifically at the trends in Hosted Services.

image::images/google_trends.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The next image is also for context setting. This is the total number of jobs and how they are going during the same time period above. Job advertisements are a good proxy for business growth.The chart immediately below is Average jobs posted per day, since 2009 but plotted on a monthly basis for better comparison to the other charts.

image::images/job_all_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

As you know, the chart above reflects all jobs posted between January of 2009 through May of 2012, and the chart below is the same timeframe, but for the technical topics found in the options Bluehost offers to their customers. There are slight differences in the two, but again this is to set some context for the overall market conditions.

image::images/job_tech_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The prior image was all tech jobs advertised, and the one below shows the trend for tech Books sold in retail. This is fairly consistent with the Google Search terms for the topics offered by Bluehost. It goes with the notion that if developers, users, and consumers are not searching for topic X they are likely not going to be purchasing a book on it anytime soon. The Search Chart and the Book sales chart demonstrate that.

image::images/books_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

So we have four perspectives on the market so far. Nasdaq closings which are consistently going up with a few aberrations. We have the number of job postings online going up. We have the number of tech job postings going up. We have Book sales and Google search for technical terms going down. Finally the chart below shows us the number of new users SMBs is going up.

image::images/bluehost_users_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

What is interesting to note, is that all of the charts seem to have a similar trend. Roughly between July of 2011 and running through November of 2011 the trend was up for all measures. Perhaps the economy was providing signals that we were headed in the right direction. Yet oddly enough this is when the US had its credit rating lowered by Standard and Poors. And the US job creation was stagnant for most of this period. So why do we see the trends in these charts. We believe that small internet-based start-ups are a major contributor to the trends up for most of the charts, but NASDAQ is another matter that we will leave to the economists to figure out.

== Open Source Composition / The Customer Stack 
 
To understand a little about the data we are exploring, you should know that as a Hosting Service, Bluehost offers more than 94 different software and services that users can select from when signing up for a hosting plan. There are 26 categories that separate the software and services. These are Backups, Blogs, Business Tools, Classifieds, Client Management, Content Management, eCommerce, Education, Forms and Surveys, Forums, Guestbooks, Help Center, Live Chat, Mailing Lists, Photo Galleries, Product Sourcing, Project Management, RSS, Security, Social Networking, Statistics, Utilities, Webmail, Website Builders, Website Design, and Wiki. But first let's understand *who* represents the typical SMB profile.

=== The Customer Profile/Dimension

Let's first look as some dimensions about the typical Bluehost user to see if they match our perceptions of an Open Source user/developer. Looking at the year in which a SMB got started provides an interesting glimpse of the lasting power of SMBs. Note that there were a few SMBs established before 1950 which speaks to long-lived entities that see the value of using the Web in their business. The peak for when SMBs were established was in 2010 and the three year period of 2009 through 2011 was the most active for startups. 

image::images/WhenBizStarts.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

There are a few dimensions about the typical customer that will provide some insight into how they are doing as a business. Based on our Bluehost domain analysis, we see that the average number of domains per plan is around 3 and stays active roughly 35 months at an average rate of $7.49 per month. More than 77% of the hosting plans have a database installed and most users have roughly 4 instances of their databases installed. This indicates that there is some sort of dynamic exchange likely happening on these sites whether it is a guest book, product list or some other dynamically served/captured content. There are about two and a quarter mailboxes on average per account with more than two million overall email accounts. Word Press dominates in the Content Management category with a 55% share, and the next closest is Joomla at 9%.

The most perplexing chart to make sense from is the average number of domains that each user obtains. The chart immediately below shows an odd distribution where there were steady increases each year up to 2008 and then steady decreases from 2009 until 2012. 

image::images/average_domains_user.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

You can see that the average hosting fee has decreased more than $1 on average in the previous two years. This is both a function of economies of scale that Bluehost has achieved and can now offer slightly better pricing and being aware of the economic tough times that have prevailed most recently. This pricing decrease may also be contributing to the growth of new users being added in the last couple of years as shown in the chart below. Although there is a slight downturn in new users being added in 2012, the overall trend for new users is going up.

image::images/average_month_fee.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

==== Sophistication level of the user base

The typical customer for Hosted Services sees themselves to have Intermediate skills in developing a website. Nearly 31% see themselves as Beginners and 15% consider themselves as Advanced where as another 14% consider themselves as a professional Web Developer or Designer. So those last two categories combine for 29% of sophisticated users. If you add in the Intermediate skill-level individuals, you get a combined 69% for a fairly sophisticated sampling. 

image::images/experience.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

So we know that the user base is fairly sophisticated, or roughly a combined 69% are. But nearly 75% of the user based built their own website. The chart below indicates that roughly 25% have someone else build their hosted web site. This is consistent with the notion that SMBs are using the internet as a mechanism to grow and prosper. The two categories that indicate more of a corporate dynamic is the 6% that had someone in their organization build it, or the 13% that paid a 3rd party to design and create the website.

image::images/who_built.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

To get a little more perspective on the average website owners, we looked at the survey results to the question of "What role does your website play in your business or organization?" and plotted the answers on the chart below. The number one response at roughly 23% of the respondents was to provided more information to their prospective or existing customers. Roughly 20% built a website to help build their brand and add to their credibility as a business. The third most common reason to have a website was to generate leads for new members or customers.

image::images/ReasonforSite.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

In addition to reason why someone has a web property, we can better identify the the nature of the SMBs by looking at what they indicate they do with their website. There are roughly 12% of the respondents that use their Site with a online store to generate revenue. An additional 2% representing non-profits have online donations or e-commerce. But nearly 48% have a site without an online store. That does not mean they don't make money from Google Ad Words, Facebook ads, or some other mechanism that generates revenue. We are going to look closer at the role Google Ad words may have on SMBs.

image::images/purpose.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The revenue size of these hosted sites varies as is evident in the chart below. The responses below are directly from the Hosted users that filled out survey. There were close to 4000 surveys filled out, so there is a fairly good sample size to extrapolate to general trends. And if you look closely you will see that roughly 4% of the respondents indicate that they are making annual revenues of more than $1 million USD. So I think our data set truly does reflect the SMB as defined above.

image::images/RevenueSize.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

==== Commerce is important to SMBs

The typical customer which represents roughly 48% of the user base, is using these hosted services for Business without a shopping cart. This is mostly for information purposes rather than commerce. The next most frequent purpose for having a hosted site, is for personal use which represents about 22% of the user base. This is the individual who just wants a presence on the web for a variety of reasons. The third most frequent purpose for hosted services is a Business with an online store which is about 12% of the user base. This is the SMB who is selling and making e-commerce transactions.

image::images/Commerce.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

Something to keep in mind when thinking about commerce and SMBs. Etsy, eBay and Amazon make it fairly easy to use your hosted site as a information gathering area and then move the financial transaction to their platforms for purchase. This federated approach to ecommerce contributes to growth of SMBs and what Etsy refers to as *rebuilding human-scale economies around the world*. Etsy reports the there are more the 15 million buyers and creative businesses in their vibrant community.  In the UN Global Compact Report, eBay Inc. Communication of Progress footnote:[http://www.ebayinc.com/assets/pdf/fact_sheet/eBay_UNGCR_2012_FINAL.pdf[eBay Report]]  indicates that more than 25 million entrepreneurs and small business owners are doing business on eBay.com. And eBay's purchase of the CMS Magento should help accelerate SMB usage of eBay as a sales platform. Amazon makes their platform also enticing by offering two packages to start selling. The first package is:Less than 40 items/month is $0.99 per sale + other selling fees and the second package is: More than 40 items/month is $39.99 per month + other selling fees. Amazon has 17 different categories you can sell in and use their excellent retail platform. Although there may not be readily available data showing what Amazon, eBay and Etsy make from SMBs, it is apparent they are well represented on those selling platforms.

=== Other Customer Dimensions

==== Consumer IT

SMBs are seeing a similar trend happening in the way they operate as large enterprises are experiencing. In addition to the changing patterns in browsing by their customers, employees are using their own devices, tools, and assets in their jobs. 82% of the our survey respondents use a typical Desktop browser, and 18% used a mobile browser. But part of the consumerization of IT is that Windows is the dominant platform in the survey results, yet Firefox and Chrome were the top two browsers. This is not a typical enterprise 'user install' which would be Windows and IE or Mac and Safari. Our data here shows that the backend enterprise stack is Linux and a host of tools, but the front end is dominated by Macs, iPads, mobile devices and a host of browsers. This is the trend that big enterprise IT is seeing as well.

While the users were filling out their survey, the Browser dimension was captured programatically. The following chart is a bit surprising in that it is heavily dominated by FireFox. The dominate combination of and OS and Browser was Windows running Firefox. Or Windows running Chrome.

image::images/survey_Browser.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The surprising finding in the Platform dimension of the SMBs survey is how under-represented Linux is which is the operating system that most sites use as a hosting platform. Equally interesting is how many iPone OS users there are and in the Browser chart above you'll notice that Mobile Safari had the 3rd largest browser share. So the fact is that SMBs use Linux on the back end, but clearly use more consumer oriented devices and platforms to interact with the Web, and specifically this survey. 

image::images/survey_Platform.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Now that we have seen the impact Open Source can have on revenue, the cost savings available to SMBs, the technology stacks most often used in our SMB dataset, and the typical SMB customer profile let's take a look at how some of the technologies are being paired and how they stack up against each other.
