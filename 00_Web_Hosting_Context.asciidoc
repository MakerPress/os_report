==BlueHost Customer Analysis

Web hosting firms typically provide a variety of services to their customers: one or more named domains, data storage and file transfer, email, and software for building a site.  They may also offer ancillary services such as web design. Prices start as low as $4.95 a month. 

BlueHost is the nth largest hosting firm, hosting approximately xx million domains for yy million customers. For our analysis, they provided us with more than one million anonymized customer records, plus the result of a survey of approximately four thousand customers.

===Software Packages Used

Bluehost offers more than 94 different software packages and services that users can select from when signing up for a hosting plan. There are 26 categories of software and services including Backups, Blogs, Business Tools, Classifieds, Client Management, Content Management, eCommerce, Education, Forms and Surveys, Forums, Guestbooks, Help Center, Live Chat, Mailing Lists, Photo Galleries, Product Sourcing, Project Management, RSS, Security, Social Networking, Statistics, Utilities, Webmail, Website Builders, Website Design, and Wiki. Far and away the most common applications selected by customers, though, fall into two categories: Content Management Systems such as WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla, and eCommerce systems such as Magento, xxx, and yyy.

//Need one or more charts here, showing the most common software used.

Based on our Bluehost domain analysis, we see that the average number of domains per plan is around 3 and stays active for roughly 35 months at an average rate of $7.49 per month. More than 77% of the hosting plans have a database installed and most users have roughly 4 instances of their databases installed. This indicates that there is some sort of dynamic exchange likely happening on these sites whether it is a guestbook, product list or some other dynamically served/captured content. There are about two and a quarter mailboxes on average per account with more than two million overall email accounts. WordPress dominates in the Content Management category with a 55% share, and the next closest is Joomla at 9%.

The average hosting fee has decreased more than $1 on average in the previous two years. This is both a function of economies of scale that Bluehost has achieved and can now offer slightly better pricing and being aware of the economic tough times that have prevailed most recently. This pricing decrease may also be contributing to the growth of new users in the last couple of years. Although there is a slight downturn in new users being added in 2012, the overall trend for new users is going up.

The average number of domains that each user obtains increased steadily each year up to 2008 and has steadily decreased since then. Since the number of BlueHost customers continues to increase, this does not indicate a slowdown in the hosting market, but may indicate that there is less of a sense that having a unique domain is necessary. Despite ICANN's introduction of new top-level domains, the era of domain name speculation may be coming to an end. While domain name growth is not a focus of this research, this is an interesting finding nonetheless.

===Customer Sophistication

In a survey of 4000 BlueHost customers, 31% described themselves as Beginners, 40% as having Intermediate skills in developing a website, 15% as Advanced, and another 14% as a professional Web Developer or Designer. 

image::images/experience.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Nearly 75% of the user based built their own website, while roughly 25% had someone else build their hosted web site. The two categories that indicate more of a corporate dynamic is the 6% that had someone in their organization build it, or the 13% that paid a 3rd party to design and create the website.

===Reason for Having a Website

Some customers have a website for purely personal reasons. Long before the advent of social networking sites like Facebook, a blog or simple website was the easiest way to do social sharing on the Internet.  However, most customers who simply wanted this kind of internet sharing were more likely to be hosted directly on a blogging platform like wordpress.com, blogger.com, or xxx.  As a result, BlueHost's customer base is dominated by businesses too small to have their own IT department who need to have a web presence to advertise their business.

The chart below shows the survey results to the question of "What role does your website play in your business or organization?" The number one response at roughly 23% of the respondents was to provided more information to their prospective or existing customers. Roughly 20% built a website to help build their brand and add to their credibility as a business. The third most common reason to have a website was to generate leads for new members or customers.

The typical customer, representing roughly 48% of the user base, is using hosted services for business without a shopping cart. This is mostly for information purposes rather than commerce. The next most frequent purpose is a site for personal use, representing about 22% of the user base. The third most frequent purpose is a Business with an online store, representing about 12% of the user base. This is the SMB who is selling and making e-commerce transactions. An additional 2% representing non-profits have online donations or e-commerce. [What is the rest? Can we lump them into some category?] The remaining 16%....

image::images/Commerce.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The relatively low penetration of e-commerce capabilities may seem surprising until you consider the wide range of small and medium size businesses.  Many are local businesses whose website is the equivalent of a yellow pages listing.  It describes their business, advertises their brand, and provides basic information such as the kinds of products they offer, location, contact information, and opening hours. Restaurants might also offer menus, and if they offer reservation services, it is more likely to be through external services like OpenTable than through an online form.

Something else to keep in mind when thinking about commerce and SMBs is that today, Etsy, eBay and Amazon make it fairly easy to use a hosted site as a information gathering area and then move the financial transaction to their platforms for purchase. This federated approach to ecommerce contributes to growth of SMBs and what Etsy refers to as *rebuilding human-scale economies around the world*. Etsy reports the there are more than 15 million buyers and creative businesses in their vibrant community.  In the UN Global Compact Report, eBay Inc. Communication of Progress footnote:[http://www.ebayinc.com/assets/pdf/fact_sheet/eBay_UNGCR_2012_FINAL.pdf[eBay Report]]  indicates that more than 25 million entrepreneurs and small business owners are doing business on eBay.com. And eBay's purchase of the Magento eCommerce platform should help accelerate SMB usage of eBay as a sales platform. Amazon has 17 different categories you can sell in and use their excellent retail platform. Although there may not be readily available data showing what Amazon, eBay and Etsy make from SMBs, it is apparent they are well represented on those selling platforms.

In addition, there are numerous small business websites that make money from Google AdWords, Facebook ads, or some other mechanism that generates revenue. In Section xx, we will look more closely at the role Google Adwords may have on SMBs.

The revenue size of these hosted sites is shown in the chart below. The responses below are directly from the Hosted users that filled out survey. Only 4% of the respondents indicate that they have annual revenues of more than $1 million USD, suggesting that the businesses represented are quite small.

===Browsers and Operating Systems

82% of the our survey respondents use a typical Desktop browser, and 18% used a mobile browser. An interesting footnote to this survey data is that Windows is the dominant client platform, yet Firefox and Chrome were the top two browsers. This is not a typical enterprise 'user install' which would be Windows and IE, or Mac and Safari.

While the users were filling out their survey, the Browser dimension was captured programatically. The following chart is a bit surprising in that it is heavily dominated by FireFox. The dominant combination of Operating System and Browser was Windows running Firefox, followed by Windows running Chrome.

Equally interesting is how many iPhone OS users there are. In the Browser chart above, you'll notice that Mobile Safari has the 3rd largest browser share.
