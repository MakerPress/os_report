Mike wrote a stub for an exec summary which we will fill in after
we've finished
- I wrote and expanded the intro, which should come next
- I took material on the BlueHost customer base out of the section
called The Stacks, rewrote it, and put it into a section called Web
Hosting Context. This could be renamed BlueHost Customer or some such,
but I don't know how to rename in Atlas   This should come next.
- The remaining material in the chapter now called The Stacks should
be left out of the build.  I might find a use for it, but I'm not
sure.
- Mike is going to rework the chapter now called Stack Comparisons
based on the new pivot Roger supplied last night.  I will provide
"pseudo-code" for how I'd like the narrative to go just below.  Let me
know when you're done, and I'll do an editing pass
- Roger, you said you were going to simplify the section on SMB
economics, presenting the conclusions as simply as possible, and
moving as much as possible of the detailed methodology to an appendix.
 I will then take a look at this and potentially rewrite.
- Roger, you or Mike were going to write up the case study.

Pseudocode for stack comparison chapter:

Dominant categories of application are CMS and e-commerce
CMS - show table and/or chart of contenders
eCommerce - table and/or chart of contenders

Who uses what with whom:

Wordpress - show what else people use with wordpress
Joomla - show what else people use with Joomla
Drupal - show what else people use with Drupal

Ditto for top-3 e-commerce offerings (or top two if third one is in the noise)

Miscellaneous other factoids that might be interesting - e.g.
comparison of language use across all site data would be fine.

But I don't think we want a big deal or table showing SQL server or MS
products vs MySql, since they aren't really offered by BlueHost.

If there's stuff you're not sure about including, leave it in a pile
at the end, and I'll take a look at it.  However, I don't want most of
the current pivots by language.  E.g. it's not meaningful to me to see
how many perl users also use Wordpress vs Drupal.  I'm happy to see a
table of languages against each other, but don't want the current
sorts that are in there.

Let me know when you guys are done with what's on your list, and I'll
take another look.  txt 707-953-2280 is probably best, as I won't
always be on email.

P.S. As I mentioned to you on the phone, Mike, I somehow bollixed the
build with the customer chapter.  Maybe I left out a file.  Hopefully
you can figure that out.
