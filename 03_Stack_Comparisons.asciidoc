== Overall Growth Of Open Source Technologies

The growth of Open Source tools during the past several years is not an easy measure to obtain. The follow analysis will be a combination of Job data along with user data from Bluehost. 

The following charts demonstrate the health of open source systems for US jobs being advertised for the same technologies found on the Bluehost platform. This data contains all online jobs advertised for the previous three months [2012-06].

image::images/jobs_platform.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Contrast the image above with the one immediately below.  The one below is based on the number of individuals electing to use the tools that are offered to them with a Bluehost account. The most noticeable difference is the large Job market for SqlServer dwarfs the seemingly non-consequential usage data on SqlServer from Bluehost. And Wordpress is the largest CMS from a Jobs and Hosted Tool perspective, but is is a magnitude of roughly five times as significant on Bluehost. Wordpress on Bluehost has more users than Perl, Python, and Ruby combined.

=== The Stack profile/dimension

In addition to the customer profile there is a technology stack profile. The term stack here means the layers of technology you put on top of a base of Unix/Linux or Windows. For example, someone may have a stack of Linux with MySql managing a database, and PHP to insert or retrieve data from the database, and Wordpress on top for having discussions. This is a simple and somewhat sloppy stack, because you can do more with each part that I touched on.  But for the purposes of illustrating a stack, it should suffice..

Now that we have a perspective and a basic understanding of customer and stack profiles, let's move into the details of each of the technologies.

==== The preferred platform

Next let's take a look at what the data reveals about the typical open source customer. Between 2001 and 2012 the market for hosting services offered by Bluehost shows the following geographical distribution. I think it is safe to say this data is strongly Open Source-oriented when you look at the hosting platform dimension. By platform we mean Operating system selected to run a website. The chart below shows what percentage Linux has in countries around the world. Again, remember this is data from Bluehost. Any country with White as a color is that way because there was not enough data to assign market share. Interesting to note that middle of Africa has a large swath of white indicating not enough data to assign market share. Maybe a good opportunity to help this region of the world get their small businesses economy up and running with hosted sites.

image::images/hosted_linux_unix.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

So generally speaking, North America, Europe and especially Eastern Europe, are strongly Open Source when looking at whether a new hosted account selected Unix/Linux or Windows. South America has a couple of pockets of strong Open Source but has in general the weakest adoption of Unix or strongest adoption of Windows. Africa lacks a strong tendency either way but looks to be moving towards more Open Source than not. The countries with the largest installed Windows platform are: Macedonia, Jordan, Libya, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Gauadeloupe, and Iran.

=== Technology Cross Adoption:
Many of the technologies work well in suites or pairs. For instance, MySql and PHP are a commonly paired technology tools. Yet there are some surprises when you look at what users install and couple with other technologies. The following tables are going to provide a bunch of data that will provide you with the opportunity to speculate on what is happening. We will offer our analysis after the tables of data.

===== Analysis
Not much of a market on Bluehost for SQLServer. The most common tool paired with SQLServer is Wordpress, yet Wordpress has nearly 400k users and only 1,000 Wordpress users also use SQLServer. Compare this with the data below for MySQL and you see a drastic difference.

===== MySql Users 593,218

===== Analysis
MySql is a dominant tool on Bluehost. MySql is also dominant in Job data and Google trends. The combination of MySql and Wordpress is installed by more than two-thirds of all Bluehost users. Nearly 98% of all users have MySql installed with some other tool from the available options at Bluehost.

===== Analysis
Perl has a pretty even distribution of tools that are used in conjunction with the language. After Wordpress, the numbers drop but are fairly well distributed among the remaining 10 tools. Perl is the third largest language in this data set, after PHP and Javascript.

===== PHP Users 736,243

===== Analysis
PHP is the largest language and tool on Bluehost. Wordpress is the most often paired tool with PHP. The drop off from Wordpress to the remaining 10 tools is quite steep and the second most coupled tool is Joomla at only 9% of the PHP market.  76% of PHP users have MySql installed and 95% of MySql users have PHP in use on Bluehost systems.

===== Analysis
Ruby is the smallest language on Bluehost. It follows the same distribution trend as all the other tools. A large percent of Wordpress followed by a drop off for the next 10 tools.

===== Javascript Users 638,965

===== Analysis
After PHP, this is second largest language in use on Bluehost. And the trend is that Javascript is growing in importance. This growth could be because of HTML5 composition of Javascript, CSS and HTML. Roughly 92% of Javascript users also use PHP and 80% of PHP users use Javascript. 81% of Javascript users also have MySql databases and 88% of the MySql database developers use Javascript.

===== ASP Users 58,694

===== Analysis
After PHP, this is second largest language in use on Bluehost. And the trend is that Javascript is growing in importance. This growth could be because of HTML5 composition of Javascript, CSS and HTML. Roughly 92% of Javascript users also use PHP and 80% of PHP users use Javascript. 81% of Javascript users also have MySql databases and 88% of the MySql database developers use Javascript.

== Language Trends
The top level trends for the which programming languages are contributing to the small business growth referenced in this work, are found in the chart immediately below. As you can see, PHP leads JavaScript by roughly 6% points. The two combined account for roughly 80% of the language activity on Bluehost.

image::images/languageChoice.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

In addition to choice of Language, the chart below shows a logarithmic view of the programming languages and their growth for the years between 2001-01 and 2012-06.  The most notable spike was in 2004 and Python's sudden burst up the scale. Javascript had a similar spike around the same time, but start at a higher level and did not spike as significantly. Python grew by a magnitude of 10 during the first few months and Javascript kept doubling its size every couple of months. This could be to Bluehost acquiring smaller hosting companies that had particular language orientations. It does not look like organic growth, but rather engineered growth. One other language stands out a bit. Perl seems to have hit a wall *pun-intended* round 2007 and has been flat or on a slight trend down.

image::images/languageGrowth.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Now lets look at all the languages that are in job postings during the previous three years. You will notice that in each of these charts there is a faint green area chart behind the bars. Those green areas show the peaks and valleys of all jobs, not just tech or the specific language. This way you get a sense if the whole US economy is trending up or down and does the language mirror that trend.

=== Trends:

Javascript seems to be a close proxy to what is happening in the overall market. There are few monthly instances where Javascript is counter to the overall market. May 2012 is the most recent anomaly. Pay attention to the scale as the other languages are not quite as big, so the charts may look similar, but scale is important.
   
image::images/javascript.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The next chart is Perl and as noted above, there was a slowing in job postings starting in 2007 which is not evident in this view. As you can see, Perl is still a widely used language, partially because of its alleged *duct-tape* capabilities.

image::images/perl.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

PHP is on the same scale as Perl but has twenty weeks higher than the 200 on the X axis whereas Perl had two. PHP is very dominant in the Bluehost data partially due to the fact that many users consider themselves as beginners in Web Development. PHP is a good beginners language because you can quickly get data in and out of a MySql table without a steep learning curve. 

image::images/php.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Python is measured on a higher scale than PHP and Perl, and is consistently above the 200 threshold. Python's job posting trend is very consistent going up at a average rate of 28% for the period reflected.

image::images/python.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

When you look at job postings and growth, Ruby surprised us with 8 weeks higher than the 400 threshold job postings per week. None of the languages measured here even have one week above 400 postings.

image::images/ruby.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

C# as a language has moderate growth and only a few weeks above 200. I think this language needs to be compared against Java and other enterprise type languages. Do you think that moderately experienced Web Programmers think of using C# when beginning a new project?

image::images/csharp.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

ASP is also a surprise that is is as low as reflected in the chart below. It does follow the seasonal patterns of the overall job market, but has only three weeks above 200.

image::images/asp.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

=== Analysis

When looking at all these languages there are a couple of points that stand out. First, they are not all targeted for Web Programming. C# and to a lessor extent, Python, are general purpose languages. Python is likely the most versatile in finding a home in many different settings, including Life Sciences, Computer Science, Health IT and other areas where either numerics or engineering requirements are strong. C# is much more of a strong enterprise language for Microsoft platforms. Although Ruby has some same characteristics as Python, it is more closely related to PHP, Javascript, and Perl for its use in Web Programming. At least from a job posting perspective, Ruby is the clear leader. From a language usage perspective, PHP and Javascript are dominant among Bluehost web site builders. 

== CMS Category

The big three of WordPress, Joomla and Drupal reman in firm command of the market, although the category is dominated by WordPress. Whether you look at job trends, Google Trends, or Bluehost user data, WordPress is the preferred platform. For may SMBs, WordPress is all they need to engage their customers, and even do some rudimentary sales where they put in a phone number to call/order and they take your credit card directly via the phone. This was not measured in any of our data sets, but it is quite common in practice.

In the "2011 Open Source CMS Market Share Report footnote:[http://www.waterandstone.com/book/2011-open-source-cms-market-share-report[water&stone]] they identify that their audience of more than 2,500 respondents 20% were 1-person only and 33% were between 2-10-person shops. This certainly represents SMBs and their report clearly shows that WordPress in Weekly Downloads, is about a factor of 8 times that of the next closest competitor of Joomla. Total installs are about 4.3m compared to 1.7m for Joomla. The magnitude of dominance is also what we find in the Bluehost data. But, interestingly enough, the Google Trends for the CMSs measured are not a far off as would appear from the other sources. Seems like a much higher percentage of Bluehost customers, water&stone responents, and job advertisements skew towards Wordpress in a fairly large fashion.

The image immediately below shows the Google Search volume for the four CMS options offered by Bluehost. As you can see WordPress is dominant but not as much as the images below this first view. Search volume has the closest differential between the CMSs. In other words, WordPress is dominant but by a smaller margin.

image::images/CMS_Google_Trends.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The next view shows how many jobs were advertised for the four CMSs in this study. As you can see, WordPress is dominant. Joomla had a period at the end of 2007 where it spiked above WordPress but nothing even close since then.
