== The Stack Profile/Dimension

In addition to the SMB customer profile of the typical Bluehost users, there is a technology stack that is being used regularly. The term stack here means the layers of technology you put on top of a base of Unix/Linux or Windows. For example, someone may have a stack of Linux with MySql managing a database, and PHP to insert or retrieve data from the database, and Wordpress on top for publishing blogs and informational pieces. This is a simple and somewhat sloppy stack, because you can do more with each part than I touched on, but for the purposes of illustrating a stack, it should suffice. First let's look at the underlying operating system component and the percentage of users in different countries using Linux/Unix.

==== The preferred platform

The map below shows the geographical distribution of users that host with Linux as their operating system between 2001 and 2012. I think it is safe to say this data is strongly Open Source-oriented when you look at the hosting platform dimension. Any country with White as a color does not have not enough data points to assign market share. Interesting to note that middle of Africa has a large swath of white indicating a lack of hosting service users. Maybe a good opportunity to help this region of the world get their SMB Web economy up and running with hosted sites.

So generally speaking, North America, Europe and especially Eastern Europe, are strongly Open Source when looking at whether a new hosted account selected Unix/Linux or Windows. South America has a couple of pockets of strong Open Source but has in general the weakest adoption of Unix or strongest adoption of Windows. Africa lacks a strong tendency either way but looks to be moving towards more Open Source than not. The countries with the largest installed Windows platform are: Macedonia, Jordan, Libya, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Guadeloupe, and Iran.

== SMB's Tech Tools to Build an Online Web Presence

The growth of open source tools during the past several years is not an easy measure to obtain. The following analysis will contain a combination of job data along with user data from Bluehost. But we are not going to look at all Open Source trends here, but rather the components that help a SMB get a presence on the Web. The table below shows the following from left to right: the CMS, how many users have the tool installed, how many have only that tool installed, the percentage of users that only use that tool, the percentage of all Bluehost customers who use the tool, and the percentage of the CMS tool share. 

[options="header"]
|=======
|CMS	|All users	|Only tool users	|% only	 |% share	|% share tool customers
|WordPress	|277,074	|240,436	|87%	|41%	|85%
|Drupal	|16,109	|7,190	|45%	|2%	|5%
|Joomla	|40,838	|2,1483	|53%	|6%	|12%
|=======

Now let's look at the same data for e-commerce. So you can see that Oscommerce is by far the largest installed tool for doing e-commerce on a Bluehost account. Indirectly, those SMBs that use PayPal may be using Magento as well because PayPal purchased Magento awhile back. That is not measured here.

[options="header"]
|=======
|E-commerce	|All users	|Only tool users	|% only	 |% share	|% share tool customers
|Magento	 |4,896 	 |1,518 	|31%|	1%	|1%
|Oscommerce	 |10,023 	 |4,769 	|48%	|1%	|3%
|Prestashop	 |1,071 	 |313 	|29%	|0%	|0%
|=======

In addition to content management and e-commerce, there are an additional five technologies that are offered to Bluehost subscribers. We have labeled them as a miscellaneous suite of tools. Phpbb is a bulletin board tool, Simple Machine Forum (SMF) is a forum builder tool, Mediawiki is tool to build a wiki that allows users to edit content, Moodle is an Educational tool to manage class work, and Coppermine is a photo management tool.

[options="header"]
|=======
|Misc Tools|All users	|Only tool users	|% only	 |% share	|% share tool customers
|Phpbb| 19,391 | 7,438 |38%|3%|6%
|Simple machines| 3,296 | 659 |20%|0%|1%
|Mediawiki| 2,816 | 408 |14%|0%|1%
|Moodle| 3,077 | 583 |19%|0%|1%
|Coppermine| 3,412 | 722 |21%|0%|1%
|=======

=== Technology Cross Adoption

As we said above, many of the technologies work well in suites, pairs or stacks. For instance, MySql and PHP are a commonly paired technology tools. Yet there are some surprises when you look at what users install and couple with other technologies. The following tables are going to provide a bunch of data that will provide you with the opportunity to speculate on what is happening. We will offer our analysis after the tables of data.

What we have found in the data is that there are two main components to SMBs on hosted services. One component is the information dissemination role a tool can play. WordPress, Joomla and Drupal are content management systems that help users publish information and represent this first component. e-Commerce is a more subtle component that reflects a more sophisticated SMB user of a hosted service. This is the component that is truly generating revenue. Why else would a SMB have a e-commerce solution installed if they did not intend to generate revenue.

The following image shows the number of CMS users that have a commerce solution included in their hosted service. What is interesting to note is that WordPress, although it is by far the market leader, does not get paired as often with a e-commerce solution. We believe that running your own e-commerce tool on a website reflects a more sophisticated user, which is represented by Joomla and Drupal. Both of these CMS tools are considered more difficult to fully operate than WordPress, but likely are more powerful when paired with e-commerce tools.

image::images/CMS_ecommerce.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The following three tables show pairings with programming languages and e-commerce systems. This is helpful in seeing how many total users have a particular combination, what the typical user has (median) and which e-commerce systems have 'big" usage of a specific language. So if you look at the three tables, you see that.

===== Analysis of the CMS Tools

The big three of WordPress, Joomla and Drupal remain in firm command of the market, although the category is dominated by WordPress. Whether you look at job trends, Google Trends, or Bluehost user data, WordPress is the preferred CMS tool. For may SMBs, WordPress is all they need to engage their customers, and even do some rudimentary sales where they put a phone number on their website to call/order and they take your credit card directly via the phone. This was not measured in any of our data sets, but it is quite common in practice.

So now lets take a look at Programming Language and ecommerce.

=== Trends:

So the interesting piece of information to take from this first image is not necessarily the dominance of WordPress, but rather that PHP and Javacript users are the typical languages used. This makes sense because if WordPress is considered the easiest of the CMSs to use, PHP and Javascript are likewise the easiest languages to use in our data set. So this pairing of WordPess and PHP and Javascript makes perfect sense. Joomla seems to benefit more equally from PHP, Javascript and Perl.

image::images/CMS_Language.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Because we wanted to see if there were any pairings that made sense or just happened organically, we looked to see which languages had heavy usage. We looked at file counts and determined which language paired with a CMS has the most heavy usage. Again, no surprises here except perhaps that Joomla is quite strong in heavy usage with PHP and Javascript. This makes sense because as we have said before, Joomla tends to be more for experienced developers and is likely used more often in a programatic manner.

image::images/CMS_Language_Heavy.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

In the 2011 Open Source CMS Market Share Report footnote:[http://www.waterandstone.com/book/2011-open-source-cms-market-share-report[water&stone]] they identify that their audience of more than 2,500 respondents 20% were 1-person only sites and 33% were between 2-10-person shops. This certainly represents SMBs and their report clearly shows that WordPress in Weekly Downloads, is about a factor of 8 times that of the next closest competitor of Joomla. Total installs are about 4.3m compared to 1.7m for Joomla. The magnitude of dominance is also what we find in the Bluehost data. But, interestingly enough, the Google Trends for the CMSs measured are not a far off as would appear from the other sources. Seems like a much higher percentage of Bluehost customers, water&stone respondents, and job advertisements skew towards Wordpress in a fairly large fashion.

TECHi has an excellent write up and InfoGraphic titled Open source wars: Wordpress vs Drupal vs Joomla footnote:[http://www.techi.com/2011/07/open-source-wars-wordpress-vs-drupal-vs-joomla/[TECHi]] that provides an excellent comparison of the features and costs of the three large CMSs. Here is a summary of cost components that may make the platforms more palatable for a SMB.

[options="header"]
|======= 
|What   |Wordpress|Joomla| Drupal
|Cost to set up|$250-$15,000|$5,000 - $50,000|$2,000 - $20,000
|Avg Monthly Maintenance |$250|$1,500|$500
|Number of Plugins|14,629|8,039|7,609
|Number of Themes|1,392 |885|54-100 footnote:[http://www.themepartner.com/blog/55/how-many-templates-for-joomla-are-there/[ThemePartner]]
|Monthly Visits to Main Site|50,000,000|55,700|59,600
|=======

===== Analysis

Although the costs to set up and maintain a CMS may vary widely from the table above, the general pattern of Wordpress being on the lower end of cost to setup, maintain and ease of usability make this the most popular tool for managing content. In our Bluehost data, the number of users that have WordPress installed and use MySql too is 78%, while Joomla is 16% and Drupal is 6%. This may indicate that WordPress users are capturing names, addresses, and user information using MySql while Joomla and Drupal users are likely using a programming language to do the same. Let's dig into programming languages a bit and see what is going on with SMBs and languages.


== What Languages Mean to SMBs
The presence of a programming language use indicates a more sophisticated SMB website. Languages typically mean there is some sort of dynamic action going on on the site or there is a need to handle more complex transactions, data transformations, information input or output and a variety of other functions that would be tedious to do manually. top level trends for the which programming languages are contributing to the small business growth referenced in this work, are found in the chart immediately below. As you can see, PHP leads JavaScript by roughly 6% points. The two combined account for roughly 80% of the language activity on Bluehost.

image::images/languageChoice.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

In addition to choice of Language, the chart below shows a logarithmic view of the programming languages and their growth for the years between 2001-01 and 2012-06.  The most notable spike was in 2004 and Python's sudden burst up the scale. Javascript had a similar spike around the same time, but start at a higher level and did not spike as significantly. Python grew by a magnitude of 10 during the first few months and Javascript kept doubling its size every couple of months. This could be to Bluehost acquiring smaller hosting companies that had particular language orientations. It does not look like organic growth, but rather engineered growth. One other language stands out a bit. Perl seems to have hit a wall, *pun-intended,* round 2007 and has been flat or on a slight trend down.

image::images/languageGrowth.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Now lets look at all the languages that are in job postings during the previous three years. You will notice that in each of these charts there is a faint green area chart behind the bars. Those green areas show the peaks and valleys of all jobs, not just tech or the specific language. This way you get a sense if the whole US economy is trending up or down and does the language mirror that trend.

After PHP, this is second largest language in use on Bluehost. And the trend is that Javascript is growing in importance. This growth could be because of HTML5 composition of Javascript, CSS and HTML. Roughly 92% of Javascript users also use PHP and 80% of PHP users use Javascript. 81% of Javascript users also have MySql databases and 88% of the MySql database developers use Javascript.


=== Trends:

Javascript seems to be a close proxy to what is happening in the overall market. There are few monthly instances where Javascript is counter to the overall market. May 2012 is the most recent anomaly. Pay attention to the scale as the other languages are not quite as big, so the charts may look similar, but scale is important.
   
image::images/javascript.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The next chart is Perl and as noted above, there was a slowing in job postings starting in 2007 which is not evident in this view. As you can see, Perl is still a widely used language, partially because of its alleged *duct-tape* capabilities.

image::images/perl.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

PHP is on the same scale as Perl but has twenty weeks higher than the 200 on the X axis whereas Perl had two. PHP is very dominant in the Bluehost data partially due to the fact that many users consider themselves as beginners in Web Development. PHP is a good beginners language because you can quickly get data in and out of a MySql table without a steep learning curve. 

image::images/php.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

Python is measured on a higher scale than PHP and Perl, and is consistently above the 200 threshold. Python's job posting trend is very consistent going up at a average rate of 28% for the period reflected.

image::images/python.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

When you look at job postings and growth, Ruby surprised us with 8 weeks higher than the 400 threshold job postings per week. None of the languages measured here even have one week above 400 postings.

image::images/ruby.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

C# as a language has moderate growth and only a few weeks above 200. I think this language needs to be compared against Java and other enterprise type languages. Do you think that moderately experienced Web Programmers think of using C# when beginning a new project?

image::images/csharp.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

ASP is also a surprise that is is as low as reflected in the chart below. It does follow the seasonal patterns of the overall job market, but has only three weeks above 200.

image::images/asp.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

=== Analysis

When looking at all these languages there are a couple of points that stand out. First, they are not all targeted for Web Programming. C# and to a lessor extent, Python, are general purpose languages. Python is likely the most versatile in finding a home in many different settings, including Life Sciences, Computer Science, Health IT and other areas where either numerics or engineering requirements are strong. C# is much more of a strong enterprise language for Microsoft platforms. Although Ruby has some same characteristics as Python, it is more closely related to PHP, Javascript, and Perl for its use in Web Programming. At least from a job posting perspective, Ruby is the clear leader. From a language usage perspective, PHP and Javascript are dominant among Bluehost web site builders.
