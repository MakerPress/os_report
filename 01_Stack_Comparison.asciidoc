== Overall Growth Of Open Source Technologies

The growth of Open Source tools during the past several years is not an easy measure to obtain. The follow analysis will be a combination of Job data along with user data from Bluehost. 

The following charts demonstrate the health of open source systems for US jobs being advertised for the same technologies found on the Bluehost platform. This data contains all online jobs advertised for the previous three months [2012-06].

=== The Stack profile/dimension

In addition to the customer profile there is a technology stack profile. The term stack here means the layers of technology you put on top of a base of Unix/Linux or Windows. For example, someone may have a stack of Linux with MySql managing a database, and PHP to insert or retrieve data from the database, and Wordpress on top for having discussions. This is a simple and somewhat sloppy stack, because you can do more with each part that I touched on.  But for the purposes of illustrating a stack, it should suffice..

Now that we have a perspective and a basic understanding of customer and stack profiles, let's move into the details of each of the technologies.

==== The preferred platform

Next let's take a look at what the data reveals about the typical open source customer. Between 2001 and 2012 the market for hosting services offered by Bluehost shows the following geographical distribution. I think it is safe to say this data is strongly Open Source-oriented when you look at the hosting platform dimension. By platform we mean Operating system selected to run a website. The chart below shows what percentage Linux has in countries around the world. Again, remember this is data from Bluehost. Any country with White as a color is that way because there was not enough data to assign market share. Interesting to note that middle of Africa has a large swath of white indicating not enough data to assign market share. Maybe a good opportunity to help this region of the world get their small businesses economy up and running with hosted sites.

So generally speaking, North America, Europe and especially Eastern Europe, are strongly Open Source when looking at whether a new hosted account selected Unix/Linux or Windows. South America has a couple of pockets of strong Open Source but has in general the weakest adoption of Unix or strongest adoption of Windows. Africa lacks a strong tendency either way but looks to be moving towards more Open Source than not. The countries with the largest installed Windows platform are: Macedonia, Jordan, Libya, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Gauadeloupe, and Iran.

=== Technology Cross Adoption:
Many of the technologies work well in suites or pairs. Like MySql and PHP for instance. Yet there are some surprises when you look at what users install and couple with other technologies. The following tables are going to provide a bunch of data that will provide you with the opportunity to speculate on what is happening. We will offer our analysis after the tables of data.
