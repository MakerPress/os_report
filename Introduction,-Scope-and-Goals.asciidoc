Hypothesis: Small businesses drive the U.S. economy; Open Source drives and enables small business.
Paper driven by a “killer metric” that tells the story.

* Economic impact is significant
* Drives/supports revenue and growth
* Offers savings and opportunity. 
* Drives employment (direct and indirect)
* Demonstrate the ubiquity of Open Source
* Open Source makes apps that had been cost- or skill-prohibitive accessible (e.g. ecommerce), broadens opportunity
* The “commercial wrappers” around open source are driving key aspects of the economy.
* Creates tangential lift in associated industries, as well as the creation of industries.

Points of Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two aspects of Open Source that we’re looking at:
. Tools and applications that a small business owner selects and uses to manage a component of their business
. The code that is used to support services they consume, such as Apache, Asterisk—and that larger organizations use to make services more affordable (e.g., you could not offer hosting at $5/month if our platform was not built on Open Source).

Question: how do we frame these two for the purpose of this paper. Is the scope then too large, and it the argument effective without both aspects?

We need to define what Small Business is for the purpose of this paper.

So what? What’s next, where does this knowledge leave us? Transition to O’Reilly?

Goals:
~~~~~~
 
* To assist Open Source communities in gaining credibility as important, but virtually silent, drivers of the GDP.
* Demonstrate that the Clothesline Paradox applies to Open Source.
* Empower Open Source projects by providing information about their role in the small business eco-system
* Establish Bluehost  as an active advocate of the Open Source movement
* Prove that Open Source gives more than it takes, by concentrating on the Net Contribution model.


Answer this question: Do small businesses who use Open Source apps have higher, equal or lower gross and net revenue.
