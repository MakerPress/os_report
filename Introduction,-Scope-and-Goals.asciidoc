Executive Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our primary aim in this report is to demonstrate the magnitude of the impact Open Source technologies have had on small businesses everywhere.  Two billion people are connected to the internet.  Almost $8 trillion exchange hands each year through e-commerce.  In some market, about two-thirds of all businesses have a Web presence of some kind, and one-third of small and medium sized businesses extensively use Web technologies.

Hypothesis: Small businesses drive the U.S. economy; Open Source drives and enables small business.  The focus of this report will be to make sense, and weave stories from the vast amount of data gathered on trends that are directly related to technologies considered open source.  Data will trump opinion in the writing and readers will be clearly walked through numbers, charts, tables and graphs.  The result will be that the information presented will lead the reader to understand that Open Source can truly be the catalyst and driver of small businesses.  

* Economic impact is significant
* Drives/supports revenue and growth
* Offers savings and opportunity. 
* Drives employment (direct and indirect)
* Demonstrate the ubiquity of Open Source
* Open Source makes apps that had been cost- or skill-prohibitive accessible (e.g. ecommerce), broadens opportunity
* The “commercial wrappers” around open source are driving key aspects of the economy.
* Creates tangential lift in associated industries, as well as the creation of industries.

Points of Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two aspects of Open Source that we’re looking at:
. Tools and applications that a small business owner selects and uses to manage a component of their business
. The code that is used to support services they consume, such as Apache, Asterisk—and that larger organizations use to make services more affordable (e.g., you could not offer hosting at $5/month if our platform was not built on Open Source).

Question: how do we frame these two for the purpose of this paper. Is the scope then too large, and it the argument effective without both aspects?

We need to define what Small Business is for the purpose of this paper.

So what? What’s next, where does this knowledge leave us? Transition to O’Reilly?

Goals:
~~~~~~
 
* To assist Open Source communities in gaining credibility as important, but virtually silent, drivers of the GDP.
* Demonstrate that the Clothesline Paradox applies to Open Source.
