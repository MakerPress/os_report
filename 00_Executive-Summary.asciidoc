= Open Sources' Impact on Growth, Jobs and Prosperity of Small Businesses: A Case Study 
Mike Hendrickson and Roger Magoulas 
 
== Executive Summary 
 
There is plenty of evidence indicating that small businesses create more jobs than the larger companies on a global scale. footnote:[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~dneumark/REStat%20small%20businesses.pdf[D Neumark]]. In the tough Global economic times that we now find ourselves, the Internet as a economic tool creates 2.6 jobs for every one lost. So small businesses using the internet represent a sliver-lining in an otherwise gloomy worldwide economic outlook. In the US, a small business can be classified as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the U.S.; operates primarily within the U.S. or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. footnote:[http://www.sba.gov/content/what-sbas-definition-small-business-concern[SBA.gov]] Other countries have similar definitions of what small business constitutes. For the purpose of this report we are going use the preceding definition and apply it globally. Small enterprises vary widely though, however use of the internet seems to drive small business quicker than other factors. On average, small businesses see an 10% increase in productivity from internet usage footnote:[http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Technology_and_Innovation/Internet_matters[McKinsey & Company's Internet Matters]], and grow and export twice as much as small businesses not using the internet. Some have compared the internet's impact with the Guttenberg press, yet it is aptly more analogous to the advent of electricity on our global economy. On a global scale, internet penetration is linked with reducing poverty while encouraging small business development. Many small businesses just starting-up turn to the internet as a means to their financial goals. But what technologies are these small companies using? How are they making the internet work for them?  Are they driving the growth of the internet or are the large behemoths? How quickly can they grow using Open Source technology?
 
This Radar Report will shed light on the small businesses using Open Source technologies to help them grow, prosper and contribute to the world around them. The Report includes data from our Jobs data-mart, Google trends, retail book trends and some general scraping and collecting of data to surface any trends surrounding the the use of Open Source and its ability to ignite small business success. 

=== Size and composition of the data sets

Before we go too much further into the data and analysis, it should be noted that BlueHost has provided us we a substantial amount of data. First the data is fairly US-centric. That is more than 70% of the hosted sites are based in the US. But we need to keep in mind that the data is skewed towards English speaking countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia which are the top four countries.  The pie chart below shows the nature of the relative market share for the top five countries.  The remaining parts of the world makes up roughly 15% of the remaining market share.

The Bluehost data has a little more than a million records that we are going to share only relevant information from. There will be no user demographics or that sort of disclosure as it does not pertain to the purpose of this report.  We have a jobs data mart that contains electronic job listings for several years. This data mart contains terabytes of data and has undergone some extensive clean up to disambiguate words like Administration, Performance, Java, Ruby, etc. And we have use of our Nielsen Bookscan data mart which has point of sales data back to 2003. Google trends will also be used in relevant places throughout the report.

=== Internet Growth by Region and Country 

==== Small Business Growth, Hosted Services (Bluehost) and Growth of IPv4 Addresses (Akamai) 

The following image shows two different pictures of the world. In this view, we compared 2010 with 2011 in the number of new Hosted Services that were established in each given year and compared that to Akamai's report on new IPv4 addresses established in 2011. Each blue number represents the country rank for the growth of new hosted services as reported by Bluehost. The pink number represents the rank of growth in new IPv4 addresses reported by Akamai. What's notable here is that the UK was the only country that had better rank for new hosted services than their growth rank for new IPv4 addresses. The US and China seem to be the most consistent in both ranks. Japan, Germany, and France showed the largest decline in small business hosted services growth as compared to the number of new IPv4 addresses. 

image::images/Akamai_Bluehost_1.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 


The image immediately above and table below represent the growth in unique IPv4 addresses as seen by Akamai Technologies, Inc.footnote:[http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/[The State of the Internet, 4th Quarter, 2011 Report]]  This is how many new unique IPv4 addresses have been identified by Akamai, and does not include any of the IPv6 addresses nor the forced decline in IPv4 addresses being assigned because of austerity measures by APNIC because of pending exhaustion of available addresses. Akamai reports on the top 10 countries and their number of unique IP addresses created in 2011, and the relative change rate from both Q4 2010 vs. Q4 2011, and the full year change rate.

The table immediately below shows the growth rate of the top 20 countries that added new hosted services from 2010 to 2011. These countries are listed in order of number of sites (descending) and then Rank for their overall growth in the number of new hosted sites in 2011 compared with 2010. Growth percentage is also shown so you can get some perspective on how quickly the top 20 are growing. Look at the rate at which China is adding new hosted service sites. More than 70% growth for China between 2010 and 2011.

Let's first take a look at which countries are growing the quickest in signing up for hosted services. You could view this as a proxy for small economies growing rapidly. The image shows which countries had the highest rank and what their relative growth rate was for the full-year comparing 2010 to 2011. Remember the pie chart from above, this chart now dives into growth. The order of countries, left to right, is based on overall size with the US on the bottom left being the largest, as we saw above, and Saudia Arabia being the last to make the top 20 countries. In addition to being ranked #1, The US had a growth rate of roughly 40% in 2011 when compared to 2010. China on the other hand, was ranked #5 but had a growth rate more than 70%. It does make you think about how long it will take China to move to the top spot. Anecdotally, the mid-50's taxi driver that has driven me and my colleagues around China the past few years, now has a Website. Could this just an enterprising taxi driver, or a sign that the masses in China will soon be grabbing themselves a hosted site. Of the top 20 growth countries, the three with the most growth percentage were Thailand, China and Indonesia. So something is certainly happening in Asia with small business growth. Perhaps a chicken and egg problem with the Middle class in Asia now desiring more of everything and they find themselves having resources to purchase hosted services. Or is this a case of new small businesses contributing to the the growth of the middle class in these Asian nations. Or most likely, both scenarios are in play.

Now let's look at the market in general to get some context. Below are six charts that will help set some perspective. The first chart shows NASDAQ's closing for each week from 2009-01 through 2012-05 which is our study range for these six charts. The next chart shows the Google Trends results for the technologies offered to customers in the Bluehost Service plans. The remaining four charts show 1) job trends, 2) tech job trends, 3) tech book sales in retail, and 4) growth of Bluehost users.  

Our job data set contains terabytes of text and is for the US only. Basically the tech jobs data are the result a filter of the whole job market where we selected only the technologies offered by Bluehost to their customers. This way we can compare similar growth trends. The third data set/chart contains Tech Book Retail sales reported by Nielsen Bookscan. This allows us to see if there is any similar seasonal effects. Lastly we have user growth rates for Bluehost Service plans. This shows how many new users are added to Bluehost accounts. Since only BlueHost and Google Trend data are global, we filtered the Bluehost data to be US only and between 2009-present. Obviously NASDAQ is limited to US only. Google does not provide the option of filtering on US only and the results are completely dominated by non-US data. The US did not make the top ten in Google Trends for the topics selected. From a City perspective, only San Francisco made the top ten at #6. So the Google Trend data is a little less localized for a true comparison. But still interesting to see that is more closely matches the Tech Retail Book Sales data. The interpretation of Google trends and Books sales could perhaps be, if fewer people are searching for a topic each subsequent year, fewer folks will be buying books on the subject. However, they still seem inclined to set up new hosted websites and advertise for available Job positions.

As you can see in four of the six charts, the trend line is moving upward which indicates growth, yet the Technical book Market shows a consistent decline.  Although these measures are not correlated, they do provide some perspective on *technology adoption and demand*. Perhaps it is only a faint signal, but enough to at least consider. Again, we compared 2009 to the present because our Job data is not as reliable the further we go back.  Much of the data in the remaining report will be for 2001 to present because Bluehost has reliable data for that period.

== Open Source Composition / Stack 
 
To understand a little about the data we are exploring, you should know that as a Hosting Service, Bluehost offers more than 94 different software and services that users can select from when signing up for a hosting plan. There are 26 categories that separate the software and services. These are Backups, Blogs, Business Tools, Classifieds, Client Management, Content Management, eCommerce, Education, Forms and Surveys, Forums, Guestbooks, Help Center, Live Chat, Mailing Lists, Photo Galleries, Product Sourcing, Project Management, RSS, Security, Social Networking, Statistics, Utilities, Webmail, Website Builders, Website Design, and Wiki.

=== The preferred platform

Next let's take a look at what the data reveals about the typical open source customer. Between 2001 and 2012 the market for hosting services offered by Bluehost shows the following geographical distribution. I think it is safe to say this data is strongly Open Source-oriented when you look at the hosting platform dimension.  By platform we mean Operating system selected to run a website. The chart below shows what percentage Unix has in countries around the world. Again, remember this is Data from Bluehost. Any country with White as a color is that way because there was not enough data to assign market share. Interesting to note that middle of Africa has a large swath of white indicating not enough data to assign market share. Maybe a good opportunity to help this region of the world get their small businesses economy up and running with hosted sites.

image::images/Unix_World.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 


So generally speaking, North America, Europe and especially Eastern Europe, are strongly Open Source when looking at whether a new hosted account selected Unix/Linux or Windows. South America has a couple of pockets of strong Open Source but has in general the weakest adoption of Unix or strongest adoption of Windows. Africa lacks a strong tendency either way but looks to be moving towards more Open Source than not. The countries with the largest installed Windows platform are: Macedonia, Jordan, Libya, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Gauadeloupe, and Iran.

=== The Customer profile/dimension

There are a few dimensions about the typical customer that will provide some insight into how they are doing as a business. Based on our Bluehost domain analysis, we see that the average number of domains per plan is around 3 and stays active roughly 35 months at an average rate of $7.49 per month. More than 77% of the hosting plans have a database installed and most users have roughly 4 instances of their databases installed.  This indicates that there is some sort of dynamic exchange likely happening on these sites whether it is a guest book, product list or some other dynamically served/captured content. There are about two and a quarter mailboxes on average per account with more than two million overall email accounts. Word Press dominates in the Content Management category with a 55% share, and the next closest is Joomla at 9%.

The typical customer which represents roughly 48% of the user base, is using these hosted services for Business without a shopping cart. This is mostly for information purposes rather than commerce. The next most frequent purpose for having a hosted site, is for personal use which represents about 22% of the user base. This is the individual who just wants a presence on the web for a variety of reasons.  The third most frequent purpose for hosted services is a Business with an online store which is about 12% of the user base. This is the small business who is selling and making e-commerce transactions. 

image::images/BH_purpose.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

You can see that the average hosting fee has decreased more than $1 on average in the previous two years.  This is both a function of economies of scale that Bluehost has achieved and can now offer slightly better pricing and being aware of the economic tough times that have prevailed most recently.

image::images/average_month_fee.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

When you look at the average number of domains each user signs up for.  There is quite a  

image::images/average_domains_user.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

These are new images and are consistently laid out.


=== The Stack profile/dimension

In addition to the customer profile there is a technology stack profile. The term stack here means the layers of technology you put on top of a base of Unix/Linux or Windows. For example, someone may have a stack of Linux with MySql managing a database, and PHP to insert or retrieve data from the database, and Wordpress on top for having discussions. This is a simple and somewhat sloppy stack, because you can do more with each part that I touched on.  But for the purposes of illustrating a stack, it should suffice..

Now that we have a perspective and a basic understanding of customer and stack profiles, let's move into the details of each of the technologies.
