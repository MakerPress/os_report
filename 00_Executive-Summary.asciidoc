= Open Sources' Sweeping Impact on Growth, Jobs and Prosperity of Small Businesses 
Mike Hendrickson and Roger Magoulas 
 
== Executive Summary 
 
There is plenty of evidence that small businesses create more jobs than the larger companies on a global scale. footnote:[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~dneumark/REStat%20small%20businesses.pdf[D Neumark]]. In the tough Global economic times that we now find ourselves, the Internet as a economic tool creates 2.6 jobs for every one lost. So small businesses using the internet represent a sliver-lining in an otherwise gloomy worldwide economic outlook. In the US, a small business can be classified as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the U.S.; operates primarily within the U.S. or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. footnote:[http://www.sba.gov/content/what-sbas-definition-small-business-concern[SBA.gov]] Other countries have similar definitions of what small business constitutes.  For the purpose of this report we are going use the preceding definition and apply it globally. Small enterprises vary widely though. Use of the internet seems to drive small business quicker than other factors. On average, small businesses see an 10% increase in productivity from internet usage footnote:[http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Technology_and_Innovation/Internet_matters[McKinsey & Company's Internet Matters]], and grow and export twice as much as small businesses not using the internet. Some have compared the internet's impact with the Guttenberg press, yet it is more analogous to the advent of electricity on our global economy. On a global scale, internet penetration is linked with reducing poverty while encouraging small business development. Many small businesses just starting-up turn to the internet as a means to their financial goals. But what technologies are these small companies using? How are they making the internet work for them?  Are they driving the internet or are the large behemoths? 
 
This Radar Report will shed light on the small businesses using Open Source technologies to help them grow, prosper and contribute to the world around them. The Report includes data from our Jobs data-mart, Google trends, retail book trends and some general scraping and collecting of data to surface any trends surrounding the the use of Open Source and its ability to ignite small business success. 

=== Internet Growth by Region and Country 

==== Small Business Growth, Hosted Services (Bluehost) and Growth of IPv4 Addresses (Akamai) 

The following image shows two different pictures of the world. In this view, we compared 2010 with 2011 in the number of new Hosted Services that were established in each given year and compared that to Akamai's report on new IPv4 addresses established in 2011. Each blue number represents the country rank for the growth of new hosted services as reported by Bluehost. The pink number represents the rank of growth in new IPv4 addresses reported by Akamai. What's notable here is that the UK was the only country that had better rank for new hosted services than their growth rank for new IPv4 addresses. The US and China seem to be the most consistent in both ranks. Japan, Germany, and France showed the largest decline in small business hosted services growth as compared to the number of new IPv4 addresses.

The image immediately above and table below represent the growth in unique IPv4 addresses as seen by Akamai Technologies, Inc.footnote:[http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/[The State of the Internet, 4th Quarter, 2011 Report]]  This is how many new unique IPv4 addresses have been identified by Akamai, and does not include any of the IPv6 addresses nor the forced decline in IPv4 addresses being assigned because of austerity measures by APNIC because of pending exhaustion of available addresses. Akamai reports on the top 10 countries and their number of unique IP addresses created in 2011, and the relative change rate from both Q4 2010 vs. Q4 2011, and the full year change rate.

The table immediately below shows the growth rate of the top 20 countries that added new hosted services from 2010 to 2011. These countries are listed in order of number of sites (descending) and then Rank for their overall growth in the number of new hosted sites in 2011 compared with 2010. Growth percentage is also shown so you can get some perspective on how quickly the top 20 are growing. Look at the rate at which China is adding new hosted service sites. More than 70% growth for China between 2010 and 2011.

Below are six charts that will help set some perspective.  The first chart shows NASDAQ's closing for each week from 2009-01 through 2012-05 which is our study range for these six charts. The next chart is Google Trends results for the technologies provided on Bluehost Service plans.  

The remaining four charts show 1) job trends, 2) tech job trends, 3) tech book sales in retail, and 4) growth of Bluehost users.  

Our job data set contains terabytes of text and is for the US only.  The tech job data is a sub-set of the job data and represents the technologies provided on Bluehost Service plans. This way we can compare similar growth trends. The third data set/chart contains Tech Book Retail sales reported by Nielsen Bookscan.  This allows us to see if there is any similar seasonal effects.  Lastly we have user growth rates for Bluehost Service plans.  This shows how many new users are added to Bluehost accounts.  Since only BlueHost data is global, I filtered for these four charts to be US only and between 2009-present.  Obviously NASDAQ is limited to US only and Google is worldwide and in fact, is completely dominated by non-US data.  The use did not make the top ten in Google Trends for the topics selected.  From a City perspective, only San Francisco made the top ten at #6.  So the Google Trend data is a little less localized for a true comparison.  But still interesting to see that is more closely matches the Book Sales data.  Perhaps if people are searching for it, they are not buying it.

As you can see by the trend lines for four of the six charts, the trendline is moving upward which indicates growth, yet the Technical book Market shows a consistent decline.  Although these measures are not correlated, they do provide some perspective on *technology adoption and demand*. Again, we compared 2009 to the present because our Job data is not as reliable the further we go back.  Much of the data in the remaining report will be for 2001 to present because Bluehost has reliable data for that period.

== Open Source Composition / Stack 
 
To understand a little about the data we are exploring, you should know that as a Hosting Service, Bluehost offers more than 94 different software and services that users can select from when signing up for a hosting plan. There are 26 categories that separate the software and services. These are Backups, Blogs, Business Tools, Classifieds, Client Management, Content Management, eCommerce, Education, Forms and Surveys, Forums, Guestbooks, Help Center, Live Chat, Mailing Lists, Photo Galleries, Product Sourcing, Project Management, RSS, Security, Social Networking, Statistics, Utilities, Webmail, Website Builders, Website Design, and Wiki.

Let's first take a look at which countries are growing the quickest in hosted services.  You could view this as a proxy for small economies growing rapidly.  The image shows which countries had the highest rank [low is best #1, etc.], and what their relative growth rate was for the full-year comparing 2010 to 2011.  Specifically you can see that the US was ranked #1 most hosted sites, and had a growth rate of roughly 40% in 2011 compared to 2010.  China on the other hand, was ranked #4 but had a growth rate more than 70%.  The blue ranking bar Axis is on the left of the chart starting at 0 and going to 30, and the red line indicating growth percent is measure on the right axis starting at 0% and going to 80%.

Next let's take a look at what the data reveals about the typical open source customer. Between 2001 and 2012 the market for hosting services offered by Bluehost shows the following geographical distribution. I think it is safe to say this data is strongly Open Source-oriented when you look at the hosting platform dimension.  By platform we mean Operating system selected to run a website. The chart below shows what percentage Unix has in countries around the world. Again, remember this is Data from Bluehost. Any country with White as a color is that way because there was not enough data to assign market share. Interesting to note that middle of Africa has a large swath of white indicating not enough data to assign market share. Maybe a good opportunity to help this region of the world get their small businesses economy up and running with hosted sites.

image::images/Unix_World.jpg[scalewidth="50%"]

So generally speaking, North America, Europe and especially Eastern Europe, are strongly Open Source when looking at whether a new hosted account selected Unix/Linux or Windows. South America has a couple of pockets of strong Open Source but has in general the weakest adoption of Unix or strongest adoption of Windows. Africa lacks a strong tendency either way but looks to be moving towards more Open Source than not. The countries with the largest installed Windows platform are: Macedonia, Jordan, Libya, Sierra Leone, Suriname, Gauadeloupe, and Iran.


based on these categories, we see that the average number of domains per plan is 3.04 and lasts roughly 17.44 months at an average rate of $7.82 per month. More than 77% of the plans have a database installed and they have 4.12 instances of their databases installed.  This indicates that there is some sort of dynamic exchange likely happening on these sites whether it is a guest book, product list or some other dynamically served/captured content.  Word Press dominates in the Content Management category with a 55% share, and the next closest is Joomla at 9%.

The average term of service varies somewhat, but with the top 20 Countries, the ones with the most service months aggregated, it is fairly consistent at around 17 months with a standard deviation of 2.75 months.  The Worldwide average was 17.23 months with a standard deviation of 1.15.
