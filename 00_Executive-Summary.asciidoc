= Impact of Open Source on Growth, Jobs and Prosperity of Small Businesses: A Case Study 
Mike Hendrickson, Roger Magoulas, Kathryn Barret 
 
== Executive Summary 
 
There is plenty of evidence indicating that small businesses create more jobs than the larger companies on a global scale. footnote:[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~dneumark/REStat%20small%20businesses.pdf[D Neumark]]. In the tough Global economic times that we now find ourselves, the Internet as a economic tool creates 2.6 jobs for every one lost. So small businesses using the internet represent a sliver-lining in an otherwise gloomy worldwide economic outlook. In the US, a small business can be classified as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the U.S.; operates primarily within the U.S. or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. footnote:[http://www.sba.gov/content/what-sbas-definition-small-business-concern[SBA.gov]] Other countries have similar definitions of what small business constitutes. For the purpose of this report we are going use the preceding definition and apply it globally. Small enterprises vary widely though, however use of the internet seems to drive small business quicker than other factors. On average, small businesses see an 10% increase in productivity from internet usage footnote:[http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Technology_and_Innovation/Internet_matters[McKinsey & Company's Internet Matters]], and grow and export twice as much as small businesses not using the internet. Some have compared the internet's impact with the Guttenberg press, yet it is aptly more analogous to the advent of electricity on our global economy. On a global scale, internet penetration is linked with reducing poverty while encouraging small business development. Many small businesses just starting-up turn to the internet as a means to their financial goals. But what technologies are these small companies using? How are they making the internet work for them?  Are they driving the growth of the internet or are the large behemoths? How quickly can they grow using Open Source technology?
 
This Radar Report will shed light on the small businesses using Open Source technologies to help them grow, prosper and contribute to the world around them. The Report includes data from our Jobs data-mart, Google trends, retail book trends and some general scraping and collecting of data to surface any trends surrounding the the use of Open Source and its ability to ignite small business success. We believe this is a conservative view of Open Sourceâ€™s economic impact on small businesses across the U.S. and World and is based on three core components: Google Trends, Employment Ads and Bluehost User Data and Survey results.

=== Size and composition of the data sets

Before we go too much further into the data and analysis, it should be noted that Bluehost has provided us we a substantial amount of data. First the data is fairly US-centric. That is more than 70% of the hosted sites are based in the US. But we need to keep in mind that the data is skewed towards English speaking countries like the US, UK, Canada, and Australia which are the top four countries.  The pie chart below shows the nature of the relative market share for the top five countries.  The remaining parts of the world makes up roughly 15% of the remaining market share.

image::images/top5.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

The Bluehost data has a little more than a million records that we are going to share only relevant information from. There will be no user demographics or that sort of disclosure as it does not pertain to the purpose of this report.  We have a jobs data mart that contains electronic job listings for several years. This data mart contains terabytes of data and has undergone some extensive clean up to disambiguate words like Administration, Performance, Java, Ruby, etc. And we have use of our Nielsen Bookscan data mart which has point of sales data back to 2003. Google trends will also be used in relevant places throughout the report.

=== Internet Growth by Region and Country 

==== Small Business Growth, Hosted Services (Bluehost) and Growth of IPv4 Addresses (Akamai) 

The following image shows two different pictures of the world. In this view, we compared 2010 with 2011 in the number of new Hosted Services that were established in each given year and compared that to Akamai's report on new IPv4 addresses established in 2011. Each blue number represents the country rank for the growth of new hosted services as reported by Bluehost. The pink number represents the rank of growth in new IPv4 addresses reported by Akamai. What's notable here is that the UK was the only country that had better rank for new hosted services than their growth rank for new IPv4 addresses. The US and China seem to be the most consistent in both ranks. Japan, Germany, and France showed the largest decline in small business hosted services growth as compared to the number of new IPv4 addresses. 

image::images/Akamai_Bluehost_1.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 


The image immediately above and table below represent the growth in unique IPv4 addresses as seen by Akamai Technologies, Inc.footnote:[http://www.akamai.com/stateoftheinternet/[The State of the Internet, 4th Quarter, 2011 Report]]  This is how many new unique IPv4 addresses have been identified by Akamai, and does not include any of the IPv6 addresses nor the forced decline in IPv4 addresses being assigned because of austerity measures by APNIC because of pending exhaustion of available addresses. Akamai reports on the top 10 countries and their number of unique IP addresses created in 2011, and the relative change rate from both Q4 2010 vs. Q4 2011, and the full year change rate.

The table immediately below shows the growth rate of the top 20 countries that added new hosted services from 2010 to 2011. These countries are listed in order of number of sites (descending) and then Rank for their overall growth in the number of new hosted sites in 2011 compared with 2010. Growth percentage is also shown so you can get some perspective on how quickly the top 20 are growing. Look at the rate at which China is adding new hosted service sites. More than 70% growth for China between 2010 and 2011.

Let's first take a look at which countries are growing the quickest in signing up for hosted services. You could view this as a proxy for small economies growing rapidly. The image shows which countries had the highest rank and what their relative growth rate was for the full-year comparing 2010 to 2011. Remember the pie chart from above, this chart now dives into growth. The order of countries, left to right, is based on overall size with the US on the bottom left being the largest, as we saw above, and Saudia Arabia being the last to make the top 20 countries. In addition to being ranked #1, The US had a growth rate of roughly 40% in 2011 when compared to 2010. China on the other hand, was ranked #5 but had a growth rate more than 70%. It does make you think about how long it will take China to move to the top spot. Anecdotally, the mid-50's taxi driver that has driven me and my colleagues around China the past few years, now has a Website. Could this just an enterprising taxi driver, or a sign that the masses in China will soon be grabbing themselves a hosted site. Of the top 20 growth countries, the three with the most growth percentage were Thailand, China and Indonesia. So something is certainly happening in Asia with small business growth. Perhaps a chicken and egg problem with the Middle class in Asia now desiring more of everything and they find themselves having resources to purchase hosted services. Or is this a case of new small businesses contributing to the the growth of the middle class in these Asian nations. Or most likely, both scenarios are in play.

Now let's look at the market in general to get some context. Below are six charts that will help set some perspective. The first chart shows NASDAQ's closing for each week from 2009-01 through 2012-05 which is our study range for these six charts. The next chart shows the Google Trends results for the technologies offered to customers in the Bluehost Service plans. The remaining four charts show 1) job trends, 2) tech job trends, 3) tech book sales in retail, and 4) growth of Bluehost users.  

Our job data set contains terabytes of text and is for the US only. Basically the tech jobs data are the result a filter of the whole job market where we selected only the technologies offered by Bluehost to their customers. This way we can compare similar growth trends. The third data set/chart contains Tech Book Retail sales reported by Nielsen Bookscan. This allows us to see if there is any similar seasonal effects. Lastly we have user growth rates for Bluehost Service plans. This shows how many new users are added to Bluehost accounts. Since only BlueHost and Google Trend data are global, we filtered the Bluehost data to be US only and between 2009-present. Obviously NASDAQ is limited to US only. Google does not provide the option of filtering on US only and the results are completely dominated by non-US data. The US did not make the top ten in Google Trends for the topics selected. From a City perspective, only San Francisco made the top ten at #6. So the Google Trend data is a little less localized for a true comparison. But still interesting to see that is more closely matches the Tech Retail Book Sales data. The interpretation of Google trends and Books sales could perhaps be, if fewer people are searching for a topic each subsequent year, fewer folks will be buying books on the subject. However, they still seem inclined to set up new hosted websites and advertise for available Job positions.

As you can see in four of the six charts, the trend line is moving upward which indicates growth, yet the Technical book Market shows a consistent decline.  Although these measures are not correlated, they do provide some perspective on *technology adoption and demand*. Perhaps it is only a faint signal, but enough to at least consider. Again, we compared 2009 to the present because our Job data is not as reliable the further we go back. Much of the data in the remaining report will be for 2001 to present because Bluehost has reliable data for that period. 

image::images/nasdaq1.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

When you look at the NASDAQ closings for each week but plotted by month since 2009 and compare it to the Search Topics for the same technologies found in the Bluehost services offering, you see two charts going in different directions. Why I'd look at these two dimensions is for some context before looking specifically at the trends in Hosted Services.

image::images/google_trends.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The next image is also for context setting. This is the total number of jobs and how they are going during the same time period above. Job advertisements are a good proxy for business growth.The chart immediately below is Average jobs posted per day, since 2009 but plotted on a monthly basis for better comparison to the other charts.

image::images/job_all_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

As you know, the chart above reflects all jobs posted between January of 2009 through May of 2012, and the chart below is the same timeframe, but for the technical topics found in the options Bluehost offers to their customers. There are slight differences in the two, but again this is to set some context for the overall market conditions.

image::images/job_tech_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The prior image was all tech jobs advertised, and the one below shows the trend for tech Books sold in retail. This is fairly consistent with the Google Search terms for the topics offered by Bluehost. It goes with the notion that if developers, users, and consumers are not searching for topic X they are likely not going to be purchasing a book on it anytime soon.  The Search Chart and the Book sales chart demonstrate that.

image::images/books_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

So we have four perspectives on the market so far. Nasdaq closings which are consistently going up with a few aberrations. We have the number of job postings online going up. We have the number of tech job postings going up. We have Book sales and Google search for technical terms going down. Finally the chart below shows us the number of new users, small businesses, going up.

image::images/bluehost_users_03-12.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

What is interesting to note, is that all of the charts seem to have a similar trend. Roughly between July of 2011 and running through November of 2011 the trend was up for all measures. Perhaps the economy was providing signals that we were headed in the right direction. Yet oddly enough this is when the US had its credit rating lowered by Standard and Poors. And the US job creation was stagnant for most of this period. So why do we see the trends in these charts. We believe that small internet-based start-ups are a major contributor to the trends up for most of the charts, but NASDAQ is another matter that we will leave to the economists to figure out.

== Open Source Composition / The Customer Stack 
 
To understand a little about the data we are exploring, you should know that as a Hosting Service, Bluehost offers more than 94 different software and services that users can select from when signing up for a hosting plan. There are 26 categories that separate the software and services. These are Backups, Blogs, Business Tools, Classifieds, Client Management, Content Management, eCommerce, Education, Forms and Surveys, Forums, Guestbooks, Help Center, Live Chat, Mailing Lists, Photo Galleries, Product Sourcing, Project Management, RSS, Security, Social Networking, Statistics, Utilities, Webmail, Website Builders, Website Design, and Wiki.

=== The Customer profile/dimension

Let's first look as some dimensions about the typical Bluehost user to see if they match our perceptions of an Open Source user/developer. Looking at the year in which a small business got started provides an interesting glimpse of user. Not that there were a few before 1950 which speaks to long-lived businesses. The peak when these users started their business was in 2010 and the three year period of 2009 through 2011 was the most active for startups.

image::images/WhenBizStarts.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

==== Sophistication level of the user base

The typical customer for Hosted Services sees themselves to have Intermediate skills in developing a website. Nearly 31% see themselves as Beginners and 15% consider themselves as Advanced where as another 14% consider themselves as a professional Web Developer or Designer. So those last two categories combine for 29% of sophisticated users. If you add in the Intermediate skill-level individuals, you get a combined 69% for a fairly sophisticated sampling. 

image::images/experience.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

So we know that the user base is fairly sophisticated, or roughly a combined 69% are. But nearly 75% of the user based built their own website. The chart below indicates that roughly 25% have someone else build their hosted web site. This is consistent with the notion that small businesses are using the internet as a mechanism to grow and prosper. The two categories that indicate more of a corporate dynamic is the 6% that had someone in their organization build it, or the 13% that paid a 3rd party to design and create the website.

image::images/who_built.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

==== Commerce is Important to Small Businesses

Percent of respondents:  53 paypal, 12% Check or Money order via mail, CC Online = Credit Card online, CC Phone = Credit card usage via the phone.

==== Other Customer Dimensions

Need to write. Backend = linux
frontend = mac and ipad

There are a few dimensions about the typical customer that will provide some insight into how they are doing as a business. Based on our Bluehost domain analysis, we see that the average number of domains per plan is around 3 and stays active roughly 35 months at an average rate of $7.49 per month. More than 77% of the hosting plans have a database installed and most users have roughly 4 instances of their databases installed.  This indicates that there is some sort of dynamic exchange likely happening on these sites whether it is a guest book, product list or some other dynamically served/captured content. There are about two and a quarter mailboxes on average per account with more than two million overall email accounts. Word Press dominates in the Content Management category with a 55% share, and the next closest is Joomla at 9%.

The typical customer which represents roughly 48% of the user base, is using these hosted services for Business without a shopping cart. This is mostly for information purposes rather than commerce. The next most frequent purpose for having a hosted site, is for personal use which represents about 22% of the user base. This is the individual who just wants a presence on the web for a variety of reasons.  The third most frequent purpose for hosted services is a Business with an online store which is about 12% of the user base. This is the small business who is selling and making e-commerce transactions. 

image::images/purpose.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

You can see that the average hosting fee has decreased more than $1 on average in the previous two years.  This is both a function of economies of scale that Bluehost has achieved and can now offer slightly better pricing and being aware of the economic tough times that have prevailed most recently. This pricing decrease may also be contributing to the growth of new users being added in the last couple of years as shown in the chart below. Although there is a slight downturn in new users being added in 2012, the overall trend for new users is going up.

image::images/average_month_fee.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The most perplexing chart to make sense from is the average number of domains that each user obtains.  The chart immediately below shows an odd distribution where there were steady increases each year up to 2008 and then steady decreases from 2009 until 2012. 

image::images/average_domains_user.jpg[scalewidth="90%"] 

The revenue size of these hosted sites varies as is evident in the chart below.  The responses below are directly from the Hosted users that filled out survey.  There were more than 2000 surveys filled out, so there is a fairly good sample size to extrapolate to general trends.

image::images/RevenueSize.jpg[scalewidth="90%"]

While the users were filling out their survey, the Browser dimension was captured automatically.  The following chart is a bit surprising in that it is heavily dominated by FireFox.
