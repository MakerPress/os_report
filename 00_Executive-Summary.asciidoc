= Impact of Open Source on Growth, Jobs and Prosperity of Small Businesses: A Case Study 
Mike Hendrickson, Roger Magoulas, Kathryn Barret 
 
== Executive Summary 
 
There is plenty of evidence indicating that small businesses (SMB) create more jobs than the larger companies on a global scale. footnote:[http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~dneumark/REStat%20small%20businesses.pdf[D Neumark]]. In the tough Global economic times that we now find ourselves, the Internet as a economic tool creates 2.6 jobs for every one lost. So SMBs using the internet represent a silver-lining in an otherwise gloomy worldwide economic outlook. In the US, a small business can be classified as one that is organized for profit; has a place of business in the U.S.; operates primarily within the U.S. or makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy through payment of taxes or use of American products, materials or labor; is independently owned and operated; and is not dominant in its field on a national basis. The business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. footnote:[http://www.sba.gov/content/what-sbas-definition-small-business-concern[SBA.gov]] Other countries have similar definitions of what small business constitutes. For the purpose of this report we are going use the preceding definition and apply it globally. Small enterprises vary widely though, however use of the internet seems to drive small business quicker than other factors. On average, small businesses see an 10% increase in productivity from internet usage footnote:[http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Technology_and_Innovation/Internet_matters[McKinsey & Company's Internet Matters]], and grow and export twice as much as small businesses not using the internet. Some have compared the internet's impact with the Guttenberg press, yet it is aptly more analogous to the advent of electricity on our global economy. On a global scale, internet penetration is linked with reducing poverty while encouraging small business development. Many SMBs just starting-up turn to the internet as a means to their financial goals. But what technologies are these small companies using? How are they making the internet work for them? Are they driving the growth of the internet or are the large behemoths? How quickly can they grow using Open Source technology?
 
This Radar Report will shed light on the SMBs using Open Source technologies to help them grow, prosper and contribute to the world around them. The Report includes data from our Jobs data-mart, Google trends, retail book trends and some general scraping and collecting of data to surface any trends surrounding the the use of Open Source and its ability to ignite SMB success. We believe this is a conservative view of Open Sourceâ€™s economic impact on SMBs across the U.S. and World and is based on three core components: Google Trends, Employment Ads and Bluehost User Data and Survey results.
